<p>Interface is argument: a critical act both to create and read. Building is scholarship, and while I don’t believe that many works of built scholarship require replication in text to stand as intellectual contributions to the community, some sort of narrative of the methods and experience of creating the work is important to its reception and usage, and to reach a wider, non-technical community, that often means a written narrative. The benefits of reaching a wider audience by replicating your built scholarly work in an article or monograph aren’t as important as getting that work done, though—so we need to advocate for student projects and dissertations to be accepted in forms other than the monograph, because the common requirement of doubling one’s built scholarship with a monograph spreads a chilling effect on young scholars’ interest in trying design, coding, and other digital or non-monograph-form scholarly work.</p>

<p>"he means that a mature work of computational scholarship in the humanities not only acknowledges the methodological assumptions underpinning its models and logic (down to level of code architecture), but actually presents a theoretical model for understanding its subject. The models underlying network structures, GIS, topic modeling through R or MALLET, etc. simply don’t provide evidence for an argument per se. Properly deployed, these models become an argument.
