<p>Intro (contextualizing engagement, not scholarly edition)</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Success:</h2>
<p>Other than my favorite favicon ever:<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/ulyssesulyssesfavicon.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="assets/ulyssesulyssesfavicon.png" alt="Favicon from the UlyssesUlysses.com digital edition, which looks like a small comic of James Joyce's head" width="61" height="61"></a>...what features of the site do I still like?</p>
<ol>
<li>The part of the site I developed for an independent study in the UM Department of Education was pedagogically biased ** original specialization: online multimedia education</li>
<li>layout and attention/distraction; context right when you need it; big help and contact buttons</li>
<li>toggling/customizing help: u2: all, none, bio, hist, vocab, style, puzzles</li>
<li>episode time (macro view of text was idea)</li>
<li>aimed at first-time readers (<a href="http://www.ulyssesulysses.com/rewards.shtml" target="_blank">small blurb</a> on why you would want to read Ulysses and a longer one on <a href="http://www.ulyssesulysses.com/challenges.shtml" target="_blank">what's so hard about reading Ulysses</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Failure:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Ridiculously nested tags</li>
<li>Non-intuitive navigation (hard to find text pages, but did include site use tutorial page: http://www.ulyssesulysses.com/howtouse.shtml)</li>
<li>Image source citations ("For image references, view page source and look under the alt attribute.", but pulls images to separate page feed was good)</li>
<li>Color palette</li>
<li>No bookmarking</li>
</ol>
