<p>Here’s a simpler way of putting it: your documentation should be so good that someone willing to put in the time and technical learning could hypothetically replicate your exact work completely (e.g. I’m hoping to make it clear how to “make your own Infinite Ulysses site”) and more probably, create their own intellectual argument using the tools and scholarly form you documented. All code should be distributed with some license allowing at least free, non-commercial reuse (and although Creative Commons licenses aren’t appropriate for code meant to be run, <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by/" target="_blank">Bethany Nowviskie’s argument</a> for not keeping a non-commercial requirement on your work is pretty convincing). As a corollary to making my code reusable and understandable, when I do get around to publishing about my dissertation via journal articles or other peer-reviewed platforms, it’s important that I retain rights to the content allowing me to make it freely available to anyone to access.<strong><br>

<p>someone should be able to completely clone my site</p>
<p>why?</p>
<p>- documentation should be that good; both as a service to help other editions be more participatory, and as a way to help the less technically savvy educate themselves toward more adequately assessing my code work on a schoarlly level</p>
<p>- twitter and social presence online are good guards against this</p>
<p>- remix culture</p>
<p>- the things i'm building off: drupal, drupal modules, MC--are all open-source, and i have a moral (and often legal, given their licensing) obligation to "share alike"; the personal/moral choice comes in at determining whether shar alike for you just means releasing under same license, or whether you're going to actively work to help others use your work</p>
