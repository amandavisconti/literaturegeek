<p>"Joyce had high expectations of his readers, and these high expectations are higher today, when so much that was common knowledge in his time now requires (even more) research and reading to be aware of. You might not be in the right frame of mind, and you might not have all the information needed to understand every reference and turn of phrase. In fact, no one does. There is no “perfect” or “ideal” reader of Ulysses, and anyone who might have been is long dead. A person ideally equipped to read Ulysses would be a native Dubliner born in the mid to late 19th century. They would have an intimate knowledge of catholic practices and theology, and ideally would have had some doubts regarding them. They would be a polyglot and a polymath, particularly they would have proficiencies in several romance languages, plus some latin and greek, as well as some medical training. They would have a solid grounding in the canon of European literature and history, and a keen interest in politics, both Irish and abroad. They would have travelled widely, both alone and with their partner and children. The partner and children, would also be ideal. I have probably forgotten some things. Sounds intimidating right? Don’t worry. “Ulysses was designed to produce readers capable of reading Ulysses” – Declan Kiberd" - http://ifearthosebigwords.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/so-you-want-to-read-ulysses-or-a-guide-to-joyously-reading-joyce/</p>
