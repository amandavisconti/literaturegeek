<p>Specific to web design/dev, but useful for any consulting job (e.g. research, editing)</p>
<p>Agree that emails/research for question-answering is reimbursed</p>
<p>Keep spreadsheet of hours worked/on what</p>
<p>Rate per hour, then estimate hours needed for different activities</p>
<p>Hold 40% for taxes (depends on state, total amount made in year over $600?, LLC or what status) and figure that into final quote</p>
<p>Clarity on finished point and whether can take emails after and what charge for any emails after</p>
<p>Emails before agreement can add up in costs of hours and research</p>
<p>State your availability to answer emails at any time</p>
<p>State availability of hours to work on project per week</p>
<p>In initial email, state preferred time period (e.g. negotiations can take so long you'll no longer be able to work by the time price is agreed on)</p>
