"Don't read the comments" 
Site
word choice in terms of scaffolding behavior
How to deal with what will be, to some extent, internet comments

No one likes comments
One view of my site is comments
-> Problem with how we think about "comments"
-> Public DH
How I'll build my site to deal with these
How I'll learn form results

1. what to call 'em (comments? annotations? contribute?) ---->
2. what do i want to elicit?

Rereading the tweet stream from Bruno Latour's opening plenary at DH 2014 (http://dh2014.org/videos/opening-night-bruno-latour/)

Thinking about word choice on my digital edition website—making words/phrases clear to a participatory, public audience means being careful about assuming people know or use words like "annotate" the same way a scholarly editor might. When designing to make it obvious you can highlight parts of the text and attach a marginal note to each highlight (as well as tag, vote on, and comment on others' annotations on the same text),

From my background in textual scholarship, I think about TEI and authorial annotations—and I'm building my digital edition using Annotator.js and the Drupal Annotation module—so "annotation" is a word much on my mind. It might be easier on first-time visitors to my site, however, to label the tool button not as "annotate" but as the more clearly understandable "comment" or "add a note".

(Side note on how academic Twitter is awesome: I put out a tweet asking what people thought of using "annotate" and got feedback in the next five minutes from @briancroxall, @footnotesrising, and @pfhawkins).

As I start to gather user annotations and site user analytics over the coming months, I'll have some useful data for seeing whether "comments" can work. (Want to hear when the site beta opens for use? Sign up here!)

# "Don't read the comments"
The days of hopefully including the traditional comment section on a webpage and expecting to thus increase user engagement are over. Too many sites jumped to include comments without a clear idea of the type of "engagement" desired or how to encourage it and moderate divergent contributions, without testing what kind of engagement actually occurred or how target users were interacting with (or avoiding) these features.

Tools focused on social conversation are doing a better (but far from perfect) job at scaffolding their use and moderating their users, but that doesn't mean that they port well to other platforms that may attempt to embed them. Cultural institutions attempting to "do this social media thing" to increase "engagement" without thinking about what engagement is wanted, how to scaffold and moderate for it, what the end goal is add to the negative reaction "comments" invoke in the cultural design world:

{% tweet 486552226618679296 %} 

This points to one of the issues with "commenting": it's used to denote non-meaningful input, the unsolicited person on the street's unconsidered two cents versus the carefully considered contribution. 

{% tweet 486542614209253377 %} 

(Note that I'm bending Latour's talk and reactions to it to follow my thoughts about participatory projects; his discussion applies more specifically as a call to literary practitioners to contribute via creation rather than only critique; I believe it's more broadly applicable to how practitioners think about the participation of amateurs, i.e. non-professionals.)

{% tweet 486544455777136640 %} 

Latour: Contributions ≠ comments. IOW, comments don't always contribute.


Latour: both editions and literary practice in general (criticism vs. contributions)

 "Contribute don't comment!" - distilled and aged-10-yr pith of "Why Has Critique Run out of Steam"

World chess tournament comments apparently suck, too









# Design for a public humanities

Comments are voice
On the one hand, reconsider standards of rhetoric/usefulness

We need to design for valuing public contributions
Good faith (https://twitter.com/RealHumanBeing/status/531944819011358721)
A thing I've learned in life that has made me a better teacher and learner has been to assume an audience exists
Not "no one is interested in my thoughts" or "everyone knows this basic thing about this novel" (there's so much stuff out there that it isn't a burden for someone to ignore your contribution if it isn't useful to them; tagging/filtering will help with getting the custom edition for your reading needs anyway)
Imagine yourself but minus 1 day/week/year/decade and write for the resource that person would have been excited to discover

contributions are wanted
comments can clutter, not be substantive
on the other hand, is that hiding an elitist standard for experience with a certain rhetoric
e.g. Don't want a bunch of "+1" "this guy!!!!<3" on mulligan's jabs, but I very much do want to know if readers are getting really excited about mulligan vs. stephen. do i keep the wording? (let contributors see they are valued) do i play editor to their authors? (replace such comments with heatmapping, general tag, annotation showing number of similar comments on a highlight) let readers decide via voting and commenting on annotations?

"contribution" might make readers think harder about what they are writing, but can also be a barrier ("I don't have anything to contribute these scholars don't already know" = don't hear their interpretations, "simple" aspects of novel go undiscussed)

"other" types of user-submitted input, such as reading experience (confusion, sentiment, intertextuality with modern texts)



# Goals for InfiniteUlysses.com

Encourage (upvote, add questions to encourage further thought)
1. remove barriers to/fear of contributing
Designs scaffolding and moderation plan for community standards
2. let community moderate/dictate what it wants/how it wants to use
3. after initial experiment, can play editor to authors (or let high-activity/upvoted users have privilege to do so)
4. AND/OR: all comments available private to their authors, but only substantive ones made public for others to read

 Worried about declining public support for the humanities? Remember that first, we abandoned the public

{% tweet 508963610740412416 %} 

 Just 1% of humanities departments rate making scholarship accessible to the public as 'essential' for tenure

Also, my quote last night, "you don't build open source software, you build open source communities," I attribute to Paul Jones at @ibiblio

 @digi_culture:  "Why not build something that can be useful for scholarly and amateur communities?" #SDSE2013 ; my master's thesis; vs. commonly held belief; not just visual design, but community design: practices, rhetoric, tacit knowledge/commonplaces, eternal september

#What's the point?

"The goal should be that everybody gets a chance to...participate in the richness...humanities brings us" @BillGates

{% tweet 472429890382622720 %} 

 Good question: what is the purpose of asking students to annotate?

{% tweet 52787073740046336 %} 

 RT @mlaconvention to support humanities, we have to advocate for their USE. USE doesn't mean just utility, but relevance, interest, pleasure
 
 {% tweet 402495714732695552 %} 

 "If you summon the courage to say "I want to know more about this," others will chime in allowing everyone to benefit"

"everyone knows" comments are terrible and MOOCs didn't work out
but annotations, discussions! (disputatins in margins for centuries) and teaching, social reading of difficult texts! ulysses isn't a book you read alone; either in group, or with otehr readings alongside

part of design for both scholar and amateur is not visual: what rhetoric accepted/allowed/required to participate

but what about substantive convos on internet that don't get labelled as "comments"? Good twitter convos, crowdsourced interp (flickr loc), etc.?
