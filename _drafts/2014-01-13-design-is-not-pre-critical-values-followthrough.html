<p>When I consider an edition and what information it’s trying to express, I’ve moved from thinking about the narrative content of a piece of literature to aspects such as its interpretations and reception history—those features the scholarly editor foregrounds in their textual notes and methodology, aspects which a well-designed interface can support or augment. This information-centered approach requires thinking about your audience and your goals for the use of your scholarly product. What we see when we encounter an edition shapes the questions we raise, the biases we inherit, and the things we end up knowing; as <a href="http://journals.tdl.org/paj/index.php/paj/article/view/8" target="_blank">Jon Saklofske asks</a> during his reimagining of the Blake Archive interface: what are the interpretive resonances of redesign?<sup><a id="identifier_3_2275" title="Saklofske, Jon. “NewRadial: Revisualizing the Blake Archive”.
