<h2>Briefly: Digital Humanities and Diversity</h2>
<p>Some resources on digital humanities and inclusivity of what we study, what we learn, how we create/preserve/interpret the past, and who's welcome to participate/read/teach/interpret.</p>
<p>Conferences, behavior. We solve this by not perpetuating it. In the DH world, people can <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/a-simple-suggestion-to-help-phase-out-all-male-panels-at-tech-conferences/266837/">refuse to take part</a> in panels of more than three people that are all male, or try <a href="http://flavorwire.com/429473/why-i-only-read-books-by-women-in-2013/">reading only books by women</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://library.stanford.edu/news/2013/07/sul-supports-conference-anti-harassment-policies">Stanford University Libraries</a> has encourages its staff to perpetuate inclusive conferences by participating "only in those conferences that have clear and public anti-harassment policies and/or codes of conduct", or advocating to conference organizers for inclusion of the same.</p>

<p>designing for inclusion http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/Overview.html</p>
<p>"NEH-funded symposium and summit that will bring together approximately 30 accomplished digital humanities software developers at the University of Virginia Library Scholars’ Lab. Together, we will give voice to what is almost always tacitly expressed in our work: expert knowledge about the intellectual and interpretive dimensions of DH code-craft, and unspoken understandings about the relation of that work to ethics, scholarly method, and humanities theory"</p>
<p>offered <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/#inclusivity">a fantastic inclusivity statement</a> that convinced me to apply.</p>
<p>I was one of the youngest people there; while many attendees had over thirty years of experience in working in tech, I'm still shy of thirty years of being alive, making it a bit difficult to achieve that quantity of experience. The inclusivity statement encouraged me to think about the quality and depth of my DH development work rather than the quantity of years I'd been at it</p>
<p>Readings. <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/">Debates in DH</a> has a number of good pieces on digital humanities and diversity (of projects, participants, audiences):</p>
