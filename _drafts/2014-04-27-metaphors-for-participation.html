<p>" came to the realization that I care because we are the cultural gatekeepers. It matters who enters our gates. It matters what is inside our gates. It matters how our gates are perceived. We are tasked with making sure that our cultural heritage reaches all." -http://incluseum.com/2014/01/20/the-danger-of-the-d-word-museums-and-diversity/</p>
<p>“"What better thing to do than to sit in a nice cozy office at home, with your computer, and find out what the guys from 200 years ago were saying about this or that?" Ms. Cardinal says. "Some would say that's an awfully lonely life. But I'm a grandmother of four. … It isn't like I'm a recluse or anything. It's just I'm very excited about history and the fact that you can access all this stuff that you couldn't before."” (<a href="https://chronicle.com/article/Historians-Ask-Public-to-Help/134054/">The Chronicle</a></p>

<p>first-time readers wanting to read with other first-timers... or with scholarsscholars of themes</p>
<p>amateurs</p>
<p>anyone who ever wanted to take part in the conversation</p>
<p>"Open authority" museums?</p>
<p>Using terms that users can understand (e.g. people don't know what "finding aid" or "catalogue" is, but they want to "search")</p>
