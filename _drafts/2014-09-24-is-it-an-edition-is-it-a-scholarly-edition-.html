<p>a way of reading? McGann, Jerome. “Ulysses as Postmodern Text: The Gabler Edition”. Criticism 27.3: 1985. 283-305.</p>
<p>"<span style="color: #000000;">I suppose I take exception to the idea that the kind of work I am engaged in, because it is quantitative and methodological, because it seeks first to<em>define what is</em>, and only then to describe why that which <em>is</em> matters, must meet some additional criteria of relevance." </span><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.matthewjockers.net/2014/05/07/so-what/" target="_blank">http://www.<wbr></wbr>matthewjockers.net/2014/05/07/<wbr></wbr>so-what/</a></p>

<p>not "scholarly edition" (historically used for specific type of edition, and enough work has been done on that term to get its practice-based scholarship recognized as scholarship)<br>
what does scholarly use of the site look like<br>
no versioning/reference to drafts of text = edition?<br>
call it "an annotated edition"?<br>
participatory edition<br>
what does it mean for annotations to be in conversation with each other?</p>
<p>Editing now also about making "spaces of knowledge" in edition to discrete editions (Steve Jones, https://twitter.com/rrkennison/statuses/421798391664746496)</p>

<p>What is an edition? a scholarly edition? is this one?<br>
"participatory" edition, "annotated" edition (where the annotations are: social, contextual, interpretive, in conversation)<br>
McGann on what I call "edition literacies" and Gabler synoptics (cite article)</p>
