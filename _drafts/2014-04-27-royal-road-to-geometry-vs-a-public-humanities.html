<p>Teaching is knowing; you should be able to explain your work to a non-specialist audience (without forgetting there’s no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road#A_metaphorical_.E2.80.9CRoyal_Road.E2.80.9D_in_famous_quotations" target="_blank">royal road</a> to geometry, of course!<a id="identifier_2_2275" title="“It is too bad that [the language for explaining mathematics] has to be mathematics, and that mathematics is hard for some people. It is reputed – I do not know if it is true – that when one of the kings was trying to learn geometry from Euclid he complained that it was difficult. And Euclid said, “There is no royal road to geometry”. And there is no royal road. Physicists cannot make a conversion to any other language. If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in.” —Richard Feynman" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/valuespost/#footnote_2_2275">3</a> ). While using speculative experiments is a key methodology for at least the <em>Infinite Ulysses</em> portion of my dissertation (what happens if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?), I also want these experiments to produce deliverables useful here and now (a participatory edition for reading and discussing <em>Ulysses</em>).</p>
