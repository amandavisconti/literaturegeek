<div>As I'm headed into alpha testing the Infinite Ulysses digital edition in a few weeks, I want to be better at recoding here the types of questions I'm addressing in my day-to-day code and design work.</div>
<div>

<h2>Is this scholarly work?</h2>
<p>Scholarly developer Patrick Murray-John has <a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/theory-digital-humanities-and-noticing-by-patrick-murray-john/" target="_blank">a great piece in the <em>Journal of Digital Humanities</em></a> on</p>
</div>
<div>Omeka digital archive: what is an "item"? what is a "collection"?</div>
<div>

<p>I find that a lot of the quibbles about the scholarly nature of these sorts of technical decisions come down not to tensions between the digital and non-digital, but between the focus of literary studies on capital-T Theory and the more marginal focus on textual studies within literary studies (marginal might not be the best word; certainly textual studies have become more integrated into literary academic departments and thinking over the past few decades, but there was a point at which studies of the material book and the textual scholarship of scholarly editing were by many set quite apart from critical literary work).</p>
<p>Some definitions might help (though note these are just my impressions of fields and not official mandates on what gets to call itself what)<br>
Textual studies is<br>
Textual scholarship<br>
My Infinite Ulysses project, like most of my work, is interdisciplinary. My doctoral studies are based in a Literature Department,<br>
recognizably "literary studies" research questions</p>
<p>I've had to pare off some interesting questions about critical digital design and the material book in order to keep this project in scope for a dissertation</p>
<p>interface<br>
modeling and studying reading and book-conversation practice: "scaffold" to support expected and/or recommended behavior, and improving design in response to observed behavior and emergent uses not previously imagined/predicted</p>
<p>backgrounds (master's from a school of information, professional web design/development)</p>
<p>These questions are both technical (how would I implement this? what's the most concise, secure, speedy way to implement this? can I implement this in a reasonable amount of time with my current technical skills?) and theoretical—the look and behavior of the interface models how users will read the novel on my site (including predicting+scaffolding, and testing/responding to how people read digital text, how people read text with participatory/social apparatus, how people read complex texts, how people read encyclopedic Modernist novels, how people read Ulysses).</p>
<p>The following thoughts about designing/coding bookmarks, reading progress trackers, and page layout for my Infinite Ulysses digital edition are the nitty-gritty of this scholarly work with reading practices and interfaces for literary texts. Remember too that after I make my choices, implement them via code, user-test them with real readers of <em>Ulysses</em>, and improve the site design to better serve those readers, I'll be writing a critical narrative of this progress in my scholarly article draft (think of the "results" and "conclusion" and "discussion" sections from a social science or science paper for a literary parallel).</p>
<h2>Bookmarks, reading progress, page layout</h2>
<p>Default: user proceeds sequentially through the book (page 1, then 2, then 3) and expects site to bookmark their place as last page read</p>
</div>
<div>Complications: desire to read on site non-sequentially (only reading certain episodes for a class, only desiring help with the more difficult later episodes in the book, need to look back at an earlier thing they read or want to peek ahead)</div>
<div></div>
<div>progress bar options: sequential reading (you've completed range of pages 1 through page x) or total read pages (you've read x of y total book pages on this site)</div>
<div>bookmarking (manual, automatic): reasonable for user to want site to save the last page they visited in the book (auto-flagging), but that's complicated by the behaviors above; can have instead or additional user-set bookmark (perhaps with alert when visiting page out of order to ask if should change bookmark?)</div>
<div></div>
<div>these feed into decision about page layout:</div>
<div>infinite scroll page of whole book (slower site if can't finesse what loads when correctly; scroll navigation mistakes from too-hearty flip gesture on tablet)</div>
<div>infinite scroll page for each episode</div>
<div>page for each paper page (allows syncing with reading in print edition if you have the correct edition; might also give general guidelines of how digital episode beginning page matches to episode beginning page for various print editions)</div>
<div></div>
<div>The determining factor may be that because of how Annotator is aware of where annotations are on a web page (they currently can sort in the order of when they were placed on the text, but not in the actual order of how you'd encounter them when reading word by word through the text; would require extra coding), I might want to limit how much text the annotations on a given webpage can refer to (i.e. create a web page per page in the Ulysses print edition I'm using).</div>
<div></div>
<div>I've been searching for examples of infinite scroll + Drupal + bookmarking, and I have the backup plan of replicating each page of the 1922 Ulysses text as a webpage, which would make bookmarking easy. It's going to be a bit of a battle between what seems to be best in terms of how people read vs. what I'm able to code—if possible, this would be a neat thing to do some A/B testing on (do it one way for some viewers and the other for other viewers, and compare how they rated the site and how much time they spent on the site). And people might have different preferences depending on whether they're reading on a desktop/laptop or tablet—I worry that infinite scroll on tablets makes it too easy to lose your place. Whatever I decide, it's an interesting problem for making digital editions readable, so I'll do a blog post laying out the different options and why I chose whatever I choose.</div>
