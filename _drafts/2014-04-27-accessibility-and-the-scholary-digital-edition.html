<p>Accessibility = universal design: Values Followthrough</p>
<p>As much as possible, design for all readers; build on existing work on usability and accessibility to create better DH-specific accessibility tutorials and standards. Library website accessibility and usability work is a fruitful place for research, as the structure and use of library websites is similar to that of a complex digital scholarly edition.</p>

<p>digital editions (text) vs. SCHOLARLY de's vs participatory scholary = extra design challenges</p>
<p>usability > universal in terms of terms of art and navigational skill (DH/editing amateurs)</p>
<p>library university usability (e.g. point to UM UX teams)</p>

<p>design choices are aimed at particular audiences; what audiences are you thus leaving out/defranchising?</p>
