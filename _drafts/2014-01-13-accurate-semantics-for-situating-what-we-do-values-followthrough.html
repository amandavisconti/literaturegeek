<p>Be as sensitive to how I construct non-digital or non-making scholarly work as I am to how scholarly building is often treated (e.g. “developers aren’t scholars, or at least not when they’re coding/designing”). I want to be wary of characterizing anything as “traditional work” or “non-digital”; these terms are too wide and abstract, carry connotations of datedness, and, most importantly—digital work IS traditional in the sense of following a tradition of practice (as with creating and designing editions in textual theory, or as with algorithmic criticism pre-computer, as Steve Ramsay shows in <a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/75tms2pw9780252036415.html" target="_blank"><em>Reading Machines</em></a>). Building and design experiments have a long history as part of the textual scholar’s intellectual toolkit; it isn’t whether something is written, or can be described linguistically, that determines whether critical thought went into it and scholarly utility comes out of it: it’s the appropriateness of the form to the argument, and the availability of that argument to discussion and evaluation in the scholarly community.</p>
