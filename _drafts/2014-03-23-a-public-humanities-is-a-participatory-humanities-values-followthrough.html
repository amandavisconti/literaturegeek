<p>Our work is to preserve human culture, and preservation = propagation (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-A-Novel/dp/0307887448" target="_blank"><em>Ready Player One</em></a>). Communication of our nerdy passions should be a two-way conversation, with the new questions and thoughts from readers outside our field or the academy brought into the great conversation. User-testing incorporates audience participation into the design as well as the final use of a project, but the digital humanities has been slow to establish best practices for <a title="DH Evaluation: A Four-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/3partdheval/" target="_blank">DH-specific user-testing</a>. I hope to help make user-testing easier to include in a grant timeline by exploring and consolidating best practices.</p>
