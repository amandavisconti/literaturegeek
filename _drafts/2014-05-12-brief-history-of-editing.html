<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Karl Lachmann (1793-1851), generally recognized as the progenitor of the genealogical method still used in much editing today</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">recension, emendation, divination (Kari’s conjecture article for divination)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">recension: establishment of existing versions in hierarchy of relative authority</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">issues: corrupt variants; difficulty of modeling multiplicity and corruption hierarchically</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">McKerrow/New Bibliography:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">early 20th century</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">focus on the material object; examining books as artifacts of particular manufacturing</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">apply analytical bibliography toward literary criticism</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">attempt to systematize descriptions (e.g. collating), large-scale (e.g. STC trying to list all existing plays)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">movement arose from access to huge collections of books in one place and time</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">initially focus on Shakespeare (e.g. good/bad quartos, Shakespeare’s hand in the Sir Thomas Moore play</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">theory of copy-text in Greg becomes doctrine of copy-text, which Bowers both downgrades (don’t use for substantives) and upholds (do use for accidentals)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">thinking about interference in transmission process: spelling, scribes, compositors, printers</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">New Criticism arose in the mid-20th century in part as a reaction to New Bibliography</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">McKerrow: “Prologomena for the Oxford Shakespeare” wanted to avoid a pseudoscience of editorial rules, give attention to intended reader audience; sets up experiments but also warns against thinking of textual work as scientific</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">used best text approach: one text that isn’t necessarily the best in any way, and vary from it only when there is obvious error (subtractive rather than additive editing: issue is that you only see the very obvious errors and not the ones that “seem right”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Greg/New Bibliography</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Before Greg: best text approach (approximate authorial intent, not final authorial intent--no recognition of changing authorial intents over time)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">“The Rationale of Copy-Text” challenges practice of granting authority to last edition published while author was alive</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">introduces the idea of authority divided among texts: substantives/accidentals introduced</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">lead to eclectic edition (multiple sources and no historical, artifactual precursor)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">use latest manuscript for accidentals BUT first published edition for substantives because printers introduce accidental errors but capture the agreement between printer and what author most wanted as final appearance of text (issue: some big assumptions here, plus they don’t carry over well from classical texts through Shakespeare to modern lit)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fredson Bowers/New Bibliography</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">builds on Greg (or misprises him?)</p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Tanselle:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">some overlap with Bowers, but finds substantives and accidentals misleading</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">McKenzie:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">“emphasized the importance of the “social, economic, and political motivations of publishing, the reasons why texts were written and read as they were, why they were rewritten and redesigned, or allowed to die” “</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">McGann:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">all participants in the history of a text (e.g. printers, scribes) contribute authority</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">textual meaning established by social contracts through a history of transmission.reception</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">linguistic vs. bibliographical codes (e.g. Byron poem’s readings as privately and publicly circulated text); Tinkle and Bornstein further break this down into iconic codes to specify the visual against the transmission history stuff</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">“socialized states of the text as it appeared and reappeared at different historical moments and by various agents: author’s friends and relatives, publishers, editors, readers. McGann did not (as he was sometimes charged) remove authorial intention, but he regarded this so-called “originary moment” as just one in a sequence of textual negotiations.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">What questions do you ask when deciding on edition type?</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Are you making an edition of a work (single artifact or imagined set of prints in one edition, which has issues) o a text?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">Masten’s <em>An/The Old Law</em>, Wayne’s “The Sexual Politics of Textual Transmission”, Hodgson’s <em>Taming of the Shrew</em>, Werner’s <em>Open Folios</em>, Schulze’s <em>Becoming Marianne Moore</em></li>

<ul id="docs-internal-guid-79223053-cbdd-8526-4996-ca6e04bfe992">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What are the types of editions?</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">synoptic: Hans Walter Gabler “invented diacritic signs allowing successive stages in the evolution of a work to be presented graphically, allowing the reader, in effect, to become the true editor of the text”; no authorial readings, all variants are represented on same page</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">genetic</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">parallel-text/versioning</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">diplomatic: “direct” transcription of a work, often running alongside a facsimile; useful to compare with a critical edition to see what interventions the editor made in the latter</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">critical: non-diplomatic, often eclectic; focused on the text, not its specific artifact representation</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">eclectic</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">variorum: all the critical commentary thusfar; “Variorums can best be understood in contrast with critical editions. Critical editions usually show a subset of textual variants and emendations that an editor judges most important; variorums try to represent all of them.” (Galey)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">facsimile</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">old spelling/modernized/modern spelling</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What is editing and why does it matter?</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">editing as critical practice: editors are interpreters of documents and what they say about the larger text they participate in; ranking worth of different variants according to a self-defined metric is also critical work</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">editing as pedagogy/cultural preservation</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">editing as creative choice requiring expertise to make end-product useful: editions are reuse of documents, and reuse is always to some degree remixing, as even facsimiles don’t reproduce materiality of the original</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">There are two things works can perform: some hazy locus identified as the “origin” of that document, and everything (transmission, reception, new versions) that has occurred since that point of origin. Thus, editorial work is concerned with a suspicion of works as documentary artifacts of texts in how they</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">differ from the “origin” (i.e. some state of some entities’ intention) and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">represent an interesting moment in the life of the text since its origina</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Tanselle: editions are useful as substitutes (with limitations) for the originals and because editorial expertise helps readers without that level of expertise</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">constitutive of text culture, not merely curatorial (Cambridge Comp. intro)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fosters new modes of critical reading based on reception, transmisson, materiality, production (Cambridge Comp. intro)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What is textual scholarship?</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Kari: “Attempting to distill textual scholarship down to its primitives, I have come up with the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">comparing</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">copying or representing</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">relating (through stemma or family trees)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">reconstructing</p>
