Yes, I would be happy to speak at your institution! 

## Possible topics:

- **What is the digital humanities** and why is it good for my department/university? How can I get started in the digital humanities?
- **Designing digital humanities websites** (and other interfaces)
- **Web annotation** for research, teaching, and learning
- **Digital humanities web development, design, and user/usability testing**
- **User experience design** for the digital humanities
- **Participatory digital editions** and other DH projects that invite and support a **public humanities**
- **Designing and pursuing a successful digital dissertation** (I successfully defended a wholly digital, no-chapters literature dissertation in April 2015 and am now in a tenure-track assistant professorship… and I blogged throughout both about my research and about the dissertation process.)
- **Supporting digital dissertations** and other digital student work: **how to evaluate digital work**, support it and track effort while it’s happening, and how to argue for the necessity of a digital format and/or method
- **Scholarly social media** for better and happier research (blogging and Twitter in particular)
- **Research blogging**
- **Teaching digital humanities skills**

I’m happy to consult informally with faculty, students, and staff interested in learning a digital skill, pursuing a digital project, or doing/mentoring a digital dissertation while on campus.
