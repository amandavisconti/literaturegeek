Beta, glimpse of Labs work, job search

See inclusivity/canon post

2 posits:
need filters or too much to process and really only want 1/2 examples er
filters are bias/interpretation

Average reader just wants reading text (preferably tablet-friendly) and 1/2 annotations per highlight/question; little space, time, attention vs. removal from text train of thought for many views

Possibilities:
Hypothes.is link to discussion on Michael Widner's post: other ways of social curation
Default random x% thrown in, can change with slider (a little dark UXy)

Algorithms and curators = make bias obvious via words AND design since people don't read "About" text

There is no minimalist (well, per era...)
Boutique edition design
Be aware of interpretations made and express these to your audience

Be aware of interpretations made and express these to your audience in a quickly perceivable way (definitely not a lot of words)

Richer metadata for filtering: Yelp buttons, anti-meritocracy
"reading mode": I value anno written in x mode: erudite, playful, investigative, feminist, succinct, discursive, controversial

Traditional editorial statements: I think I have x biases or ignorances, I have y background influencing me = demographics and personal experience and personal interests (what I might notice and not notice)

Solution:
reading text + "lab" text
lab text: different ways of reading, experiments in filtering/what you're shown, experiments in making annotations hypermedic/not rectangles/Ulysses Seen comic, view page zoomed out with stacked annos around sides
heatmap
