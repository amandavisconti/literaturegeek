<p><em>"The slow death of Flash also leaves a host of [e-lit] authors who can no longer create in their chosen medium. It’s as if a novelist were told that she could no longer use a word processor—indeed, no longer even use words. Or is it?"</em></p>
<p>I'm pleased to be part of Mark Sample's MLA '14 roundtable proposal, "Electronic Literature after Flash". You can <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/electronic-literature-after-flash-mla14-proposal" target="_blank">read the whole proposal</a> over on Mark's blog (which, incidentally, has just a lot of great writing about DH and about teaching as scholarship)--I'll be joining a group of both e-lit scholars and authors: Mark, Leo Flores, Chris Funkhouser, Dene Grigar, Mark Marino, Stuart Moulthrop, and Zach Whalen.</p>
<p>Here's the chunk on my part of the roundtable:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/www.literaturegeek.com">Amanda Visconti</a> surveys the way e-lit can appropriate digital platforms that were never designed for poetics or narrative. Visconti argues that such platform poaching combines the veneer of credibility associated with a digital archive or a wiki with a narrative license that is simultaneously ethically dangerous and rich with possibilities for counterfactual knowledge.</p>
<p>I want to discuss the ethics and possibilities of e-lit’s distorting occupation of platforms intended for other uses—more specifically, to start a conversation about the mindful misuse of academic or similarly  “credible” platforms. E-lit built off social media frameworks (e.g. <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/urban3zero.com">The Urban 30</a>, the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/laflood.citychaos.com">LA Flood project</a>), while not always immediately recognizable as fictional, at least carries with it our awareness of the biases and misinformation of news and gossip. Combining the veneer of credibility associated with a digital archive or wiki framework with narrative license is a tactic both ethically dangerous and rich with possibilities for ‘patacritical and counterfactual knowledges. I’ll briefly outline a few such e-lit appropriations and warpings of credible platforms, such as the speculative but factually grounded <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Headside">Anglish Moot</a> constructed language wiki and the counterfactually half-true eduARG <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/www.arcanegalleryofgadgetry.com" target="_blank"><em>The Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry</em></a>’s historical wiki, as well as mention a few platforms ripe for creative misuse. This lightning talk should provoke discussion about the ethics of e-lit, weirding existing platforms, and the role of e-lit in communicating factual knowledge.</p>
