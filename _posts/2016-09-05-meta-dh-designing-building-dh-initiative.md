I'm [starting a "meta-DH" series of blog posts](http://literaturegeek.com/tag/meta-dh/) to document my work developing a digital humanities initiative here in the Libraries at Purdue University. This work includes creating a DH physical space (center? lab? something else?) and the practical considerations of layout and budgeting, designing policies and infrastructure for the initiative, and building DH projects both to test our policies and to model the kinds of scholarship our methods realize.

If you've been on [this blog](http://www.literaturegeek.com) before, you might have noticed that I enjoy blogging and other user-friendly [documentation](http://literaturegeek.com/tag/advice-tutorial/) of DH scholarship. This style of writing helps me think, with the bonus that sometimes that thinking is useful to others. Blogging can also lead to feedback on resources I should check out, potential collaborators, and what I'm doing wrong.

My first year on the job meant writing a lot of GoogleDocs and other semi-private stuff: taking notes on meetings and consultations, recording ideas for projects, and explaining my plans to administration. To communicate more clearly (and use my colleagues' generous donation of their reading time well), this means I generate a lot of documentation that hasn't reached anyone else yet. I think the non-condensed versions of these ideas could be useful to someone–thus, this series of posts!

I'll probably blog:

1. ✔️ [The job talk that put me in this role (already blogged earlier this year)](http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk)
2. Creating the website for our DH initiative
3. My first year on the job: doing a campus DH survey & testing out personal policies (e.g. making good time & resource investments)
4. How I've interpreted my job description
5. Working with my faculty review committee to receive credit for my various kinds of DHy scholarship
6. Daily practices (my office setup, software used, consultations, etc.)
7. DH program identity and choosing what to call our initiative (center? lab?)
8. My formal DH initiative proposal to department administration
9. Designing and following through on a DH mission statement
10. Partnerships and collaboration
11. Defining DH scope
12. Designing timelines and funding requests
13. Creating a DH space: layout, equipment, budget
14. Grant proposals and sustainable models

If there's stuff I've left out that you'd like to read about, let me know on Twitter or by email. I can't promise I'll blog about it, but hearing a topic would be useful to someone is a pretty good motivation to do so!
