<p>One Week | One Tool, the digital humanities barn-raising I described <a title="Digital Projects from Start to Finish: DH Mentorship from One Week One Tool (OWOT)" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/owotdayone">in an earlier post</a>, is wrapping up; we released the tool we built in less than a week (Tuesday afternoon through Friday afternoon, to be exact), <a href="http://www.serendip-o-matic.com" target="_blank">Serendip-o-matic.</a> Head on over to the site to check it out and let your sources surprise you--I recommend trying both the option to take your Zotero library for a spin, and also submitting some beloved text like song lyrics or a book chapter. You might even try an interesting Wikipedia article and discover some new branches of information to explore!</p>

<p>Site visitors are already tweeting screenshots of their results, and some have even advanced their research with their first visit:</p>

<p>We're all exhausted and full of new knowledge and very happy with our work. Before he head out to a celebratory dinner not at The Well (the hotel bar where we had to grab most of our meals this week), I'm capturing a few notes on the experience.</p>

<h3>Project Ideas, Criteria, and Projects vs. Tools</h3>
<p>Producing a working tool was an awesome experience, but Monday and Tuesday's debates before we decided on our project was also a useful experience. We talked about the gaps in our digital experience and what tools might fill them, and developed very high-level pseudocode-type explanations for how the ten or so ideas that made it to public voting would work--work we hope to capture and submit to the developing DiRT DH tool wishlist.</p>
<p>Criteria for choosing the tool included</p>
<ul>
<li>work our skills allowed (no mobile apps meant nixing the oral history recording idea),</li>
<li>accessibility,</li>
<li>text-centrism (could we work with images or audio?),</li>
<li>scope (could we deploy the tool in a few days?),</li>
<li>would the tool actually be used? (what people say they want can be different from what they'd actually use; sometimes creating a tool creates or reveals a need),</li>
<li>an interface that allowed users to quickly try the tool without reading too much textual documentation,</li>
<li>ease of explanation for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Update: immediately below are photos from the process of choosing which tool we'd build.</em></p>

<p>Another take-away from earlier in the week was the difference between brainstorming projects and tools: often we generated ideas that involved generating or creating structures for content, such as an archive for audio descriptions of visual art for blind museum-goers, or a place to list DH dream-tool ideas so that bored DH coders could get inspiration for work that would serve the community. I realized that often my ideas for DH creations are <em>projects</em> and not tools, or at least somewhere in a gray area in-between, with the code work closely tied to the generation of inclusion of specific topic (<a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/infinite-ulysses-intro">Infinite Ulysses</a>, for example). This might have something to do with my skillset, which is weighted toward interface development and design, but it reminded me it might be interesting to create a DH object that can be applied to multiple research areas.</p>
<h3>Coding Schedule</h3>
<p>A quick glance at graphs of our code commits to <a href="https://github.com/chnm/serendipomatic" target="_blank">the Github repository</a> over the week shows a predictable trend (and some Friday 3am coding!):<br>

<h3>Hippos, Mustaches, and J.K Rowling</h3>
<p>As commit messages started to shoot out quicker and closer to the deadline, clarity decreased. We ended up making a lot of small commits to make sure everyone was working with the same code.</p>

<p>We used a photo of J.K. Rowling as a filler for results without images; combined with an error causing the filler image to peep up behind other photos, it produced a frightening effect:<br>
