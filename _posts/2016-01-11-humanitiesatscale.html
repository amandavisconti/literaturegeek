<p>I research, design, and code interfaces that use digital humanities approaches to create smarter online communities, and when I tell others about my work it&#39;s become a habit to append &quot;digital humanities&quot; with an explainer that&#39;s more about the &quot;humanities&quot; than the &quot;digital&quot; part: something like</p>
<blockquote><p>literature, history, design and the arts, ethics, cultural heritage, museums, and libraries</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with a kicker about the &quot;digital&quot; meaning &quot;websites and digital tools for research, teaching, learning, and reading&quot;, when I&#39;m not also going on to talk about the specific types of things I build as examples of what this means (<em>stuff like the social annotation+reading platform <a href='InfiniteUlysses.com'   >InfiniteUlysses.com</a>, which tries to bring complex texts to broader audiences through conversation and personalization</em>). </p>
<p>I don&#39;t mean to add yet another definition of the digital humanities with this post (<em>see <a href='http://www.whatisdigitalhumanities.com' target='_blank' >WhatIsDigitalHumanities.com</a></em>), but rather to share some notes on a major meta-problem of humanities scholars&#39; work: people in general don&#39;t know what &quot;humanities&quot; means.</p>
<p>Just as with science, there&#39;s a ton of humanities work for which &quot;scale&quot; or wide impact <em>must not</em> be a measure, or we&#39;ll end up not knowing or remembering anything. And as with libraries and IT,</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/rrkennison">@rrkennison</a> When you do your job of being a librarian well, you don&#39;t hear about it. Me: kind of like IT. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MLA16?src=hash">#MLA16</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/s632?src=hash">#s632</a></p>&mdash; Patricia Hswe (@pmhswe) <a href="https://twitter.com/pmhswe/status/685940205950373889">January 9, 2016</a></blockquote></p>

<p>That said, I want a world where more humanities work reaches the public, and one aspect of achieving this (<em>besides e.g. helping humanities researchers learn to speak with voices that reach diverse audiences</em>) is connecting all the pieces of the humanities—the films, stories, paintings, famous speeches and everyday diary entries and forgotten lives—back to our overarching field of the humanities. Let&#39;s start by identifying the projects that somehow lose the term &quot;humanities&quot; when they start to function at scale, and think about the differences between these and smaller humanities projects (e.g. how much volunteer work do they rely on? whose volunteer work? are they designed by people inside or outside academic institutions?...).</p>
<p>(<em>Note also that I tend to ID things that I think are cool as [digital] humanities, probably because I&#39;m a humanist—but more charitably because my training helps me see the humanistically subjective, narrative, historically-grounded characteristics that can really be found in most stuff. More on this in a future post!</em>)</p>
<h2>A humanities at scale...</h2>
<h2>…exists as things that don't call themselves &quot;humanities&quot; </h2>
<p><em>These are projects that both benefit from scaling up (broaden/deepen their humanities outreach) and lose out from scale (they're not always thought of as &quot;humanities&quot;, so don't accrue interest, understanding back to the humanities). Many of these projects' creators don't work in formal academic roles. It's worth thinking about the emotional labor of moderation, curation, and other types of volunteered work that goes into creating, filling, and maintaining huge projects like these... more fodder for a future post.<?p>
<p>Here are some huge initiatives that broadly can be identified as humanities work:</em></p>
<ul><li>
<a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/'   >Project Gutenberg</a> (and the newer initiative <a href='https://www.gitenberg.org/'   >Gitenberg</a>!)</li>
<li>
<a href='https://www.wikipedia.org/'   >Wikipedia</a> and its related initiatives</li>
<li>
Alternate reality games (especially those that teach through interactive narrative, like <a href='http://dustgame.byu.edu/'   >DUST</a> and the <a href='http://www.playthepast.org/?p=1888'   >Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry</a>)</li>
<li>
<a href='http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page'   >Archive Team</a> (e.g. <a href='http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=GeoCities'   ><em>saving</em> Geocities</a>)</li>
<li>
<a href='Internet Archive'   >Internet Archive</a></li>
<li>
History passed down by &quot;communities of practice&quot;. <em>To be less academic: think of swing dancing and its popularity as a movement among younger generations. Swing dancing is history passed down through speech and movement, blogs and websites, and YouTube videos of competitions and tutorials.</em></li>
<li>
<a href='http://wefeelfine.org/'   >We Feel Fine</a> and other massive visualizations of human emotion and thought (as recorded by social media)</li>
</ul>
<h2>…May develop strong online user communities by focusing on specific* humanities periods/themes</h2>
<p><em>And don&#39;t noticeably use &quot;humanities&quot; as a descriptor.</em></p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href='https://transcription.si.edu/'   >Smithsonian Transcription</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href='https://www.zooniverse.org/'   >Zooniverse</a></p>

<p><a href='http://wardepartmentpapers.org/'   >War Department Papers</a></p>
</li>

<p>NYPL Labs&#39; projects like <a href='http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/'   >Building Inspector</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of other meaningful crowdsourcing projects highlighted by the <a href='http://www.crowdconsortium.org/'   >Crowd Consortium</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My <a href='http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com'   >InfiniteUlysses.com</a> (Reached 13,000 unique visitors during the first month of open beta. At about 20k unique visitors after existing nine months with very little publicity—people want to read difficult books!)</p>
<p><em>*Or not so specific? I&#39;m not sure what projects like Smithsonian Transcription, Zooniverse, and NARA Citizen Archivist Dashboard see in terms of participants working across multiple, unthematically related projects—or if the majority of users tend to pick one project matching an interest and stick with it.</em></p>
<h2>Other humanities-at-scale initiatives</h2>
<p><em>Not otherwise categorized, and worth examining:</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various serious and/or well-moderated subreddits (<a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians'   >/askhistorians</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href='http://dp.la'   >The Digital Public Library of America</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href='http://www.vox.com'   >Vox</a>? (and similar explainers grounded in greater narratives? this historical grounding is more a hallmark of good journalism, but the move toward &quot;explainers&quot; that explicitly reach out to readers who may be hearing about a topic <em>and</em> its history for the first time feels newer)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href='http://www.Omeka.net'   >Omeka.net</a></p>

<h2>Whose humanities at scale?</h2>
<p>An upcoming blog post (which will be linked here when available!) will address a regular problem with projects &quot;for the public&quot;: their design and content assumes certain backgrounds that means &quot;the public&quot; who can most easily use these projects is often people already served by higher education institutions.</p>
