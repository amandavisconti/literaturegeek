I'm starting as Managing Director of the University of Virginia's Scholars' Lab later this spring! Academic Director Alison Booth wrote [a lovely post about my hire on the Scholars' Lab blog](http://scholarslab.org/uncategorized/amanda-visconti-is-our-new-managing-director/).

The Scholars' Lab is a digital humanities center at the University of Virginia Libraries, and a founding member of the [CenterNet](http://dhcenternet.org/) international network of DH centers. The Lab has [an amazing team of DH experts](http://scholarslab.org/people/) (including new Head of Graduate Programs [Brandon Walsh](https://twitter.com/walshbr)), [a team-authored charter](http://scholarslab.org/about/charter/) I deeply respect, and past and current work including:

- [Neatline](http://neatline.org/), "a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections"
- [Speaking in Code](http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/), a symposium of advanced DH developers discussing tacit DH tech knowledge
- The [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) and [Network](http://praxis-network.org/)—innovative models of DH student training, where students have collaboratively created projects such as [Prism](http://prism.scholarslab.org/) and an [Ivanhoe reboot](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/)
- An [experimental humanities Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/)
- Leadership Alliance Mellon Initiative (LAMI) fellows (supporting minority students interested in graduate studies)

And even more work captured in this 2016 [blog post](http://scholarslab.org/uncategorized/whats-the-scholars-lab/) by Alison Booth and on the [Scholars' Lab research page](http://scholarslab.org/research/). 

I'm deeply honored to join and excited to work with the Scholars' Lab team and community, and looking forward to being back in the VA/MD area. 

The [next post on this blog](http://literaturegeek.com/2017/02/23/scholars-lab-dh-center-managing-director-job-talk) will share the job talk I gave while interviewing for this role, and you could also check out [my previous role's job talk](http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk) if you're interested in interviewing for DHy positions.
