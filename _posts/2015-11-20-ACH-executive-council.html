<p>I'm running for a seat on the Executive Council of the ACH (Association for Computers and the Humanities), the professional society for the digital humanities. If you're a member, please consider voting for me! I'd bring a focus on</p> 
<ul>
<li><strong>support for undergrad and grad students</strong> (particularly in getting their DH work fully accepted as scholarship, whether as coursework or dissertation) and on </li><li><strong>improving the DH social media community</strong> (making it easier for new DHers to be involved, expanding the teaching/learning we do via social media, and improving how backchannels like Twitter and <a href="http://bit.ly/1jI8VUx">Slack</a> are preserved and made accessible).</li></ul>

<h2>Candidate statement</h2>
<p>I'm honored to be nominated for a position on the ACH Executive Council. As a recent Ph.D., I'm especially interested in <strong>advocating for student digital humanists</strong>, such as reaching out to the Undergraduate Network for Research in the Humanities (UNRH) and assembling a central web resource for digital humanities dissertations: case studies, administrative documents used by successful dissertators, and links to supporting arguments and tutorials for DH forms of graduate research. (<em>The structure of this resource could be cloned to support a paired second site focused on review and promotion applications by those in DH job roles—managed by another ACH volunteer—as there are considerable overlaps in these two challenging areas.</em>)</p>
<p>I'm also interested in <strong>supporting and improving the ways the digital humanities community uses Twitter and other social media</strong>, especially as developing technologies such as Slack (online messaging and chat rooms) and Hypothes.is (web annotation) become part of our online ecosystem. In the case of Slack, anchoring <a href="http://bit.ly/1jI8VUx">the new DH Slack team</a> I've organized—which now has 197 digital humanist members!—to ACH would let us argue for non-profit status, which confers benefits like better chat history and search.</p>
<p>I'd like to <strong>standardize how we preserve DH social media</strong>, particularly tweets using various DH conference hashtags, by exploring whether a specific ACH role could be in charge of capturing these in a given year and storing them in a publicly accessible space. I'd also like to <strong>investigate ways of encouraging the DH Q & A site as a first-stop intro to DH</strong> (e.g. a wiki for FAQs like what conference acronyms and hashtags stand for) and whether social mechanics (favoriting, badges) might motivate more DHers to ask and answer questions on the site.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am a DH hybrid: a web developer, as well as librarian, assistant professor, and the Digital Humanities Specialist at the Purdue University Libraries. I recently completed a digital humanities dissertation in the University of Maryland English Department, and I also hold a master's degree from the University of Michigan School of Information, where I tailored a Digital Humanities HCI specialization. I worked in a number of positions at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) fromm 2009-2015, beginning as an IMLS Model Digital Humanities Intern and ending as the Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow. I've been a professional web developer for over eight years, and most of my research takes the form of making things for the web.<p>
<p>I've been active in the digital humanities community since 2009, tweeting <a href="http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek">@Literature_Geek</a> and keeping a popular DH blog at <a href="http://www.LiteratureGeek.com">LiteratureGeek.com</a> (11 posts have been highlighted on DH Now; LiteratureGeek.com/tag/dh-now). My major projects include co-organizing the inaugural THATCamp Games with Anastasia Salter, applying one of the inaugural ACH Microgrants (now Incubator Grants) to visualize Digital Humanities Quarterly's citation network, the creation of a participatory digital edition (<a href="http://www.infiniteulysses.com">InfiniteUlysses.com</a>; over 13,000 unique visitors during its first month of open beta), and successfully designing and defending a unique "born-digital" digital humanities dissertation consisting of design, code, user-testing, blogging, and a whitepaper written in the final weeks of the project (<a href="http://dr.amandavisconti.com">Dr.AmandaVisconti.com</a>).</p>
