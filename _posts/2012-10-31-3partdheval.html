<p>DH evaluation! I wrote my <a href="http://si.umich.edu">iSchool</a> <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380">master’s thesis</a> on evaluating and serving audiences for digital humanities archives (<a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380">full text available here</a>; my advisor was Professor Paul Conway), and my nascent Ph.D. dissertation will incorporate user testing of my own digital literary code as well as suggest some best practices for DH user testing on a limited budget. Given this background, I’ll be publishing for the next <del>three</del> four days on <strong>user testing, an area of evaluation that foregrounds the user--the use, usefulness, and usability of your digital work for a given audience</strong>. It's my hope to make each of these posts applicable to people working on small budgets and/or on their own. The posts in this series are:</p>

<p>The posts cover "quick and dirty", practical ways of making your DH project more user-aware; an argument for designing DH projects that serve not only scholars, but also a wider, public-DH audience of "amateurs"; a description of a use study run on amateur users of digital humanities archives; existing examples of DH user testing by researchers from different backgrounds, on different types of audiences; and choicemaking about evaluating use, usefulness, or usability for your DH work.</p>
