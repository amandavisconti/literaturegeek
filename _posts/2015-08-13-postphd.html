<p>I'm starting as Digital Humanities Specialist (a tenure-track assistant professorship in the Libraries) at Purdue University next week! I'm feeling excited (and very lucky) to have found a role that fits me so well.</p>

<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>It's important to me to continue using a variety of methods in my day-to-day work, including web design and coding, project design and research, and diverse forms of teaching and mentorship. I feel extremely lucky to have found a position that celebrates these various modes of scholarship! For example, I might elect to teach in a formal classroom style, or co-teach a hands-on course in an archive, lead technical workshops and skills training, and/or bridge between DH and other fields via advocacy, pedagogy, and translation. I'll also offer training workshops, consultations, and pursue personal and collaborative research. There's not just allowance but strong encouragement for this interdisciplinarity throughout the organization, from Dean of Libraries James Mullins down.</p>

<p>Purdue offers some fantastic DH, digital libraries, and related work on campus, especially the interdisciplinary collaboration of the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/grant-news/announcing-20-digital-humanities-start-grant-awards-march-2014">NEH Start-Up Grant</a>-supported <a href="http://blackpressresearchcollective.org/">Black Press Research Collective</a>, founded and directed by Dr. Kim Gallon, a professor in the Purdue History Department. Purdue won the <a href="http://www.arl.org/news/community-updates/3512-purdue-wins-excellence-in-academic-libraries-award-2015">Excellence in Academic Libraries award</a> for university libraries from the the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) this year. The way the Libraries' strategy and mission statement translate to everyday tactics is really obvious in projects like the <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/impact/">IMPACT program</a> is an initiative to transform and redesign core, larger-size undergraduate courses, including collaboration with the Libraries and <a href="https://www.lib.purdue.edu/infolit/impact">a re-invigorated emphasis on teaching information literacy</a> in its various forms.</p>

<h2>Plans for the first year</h2>
<p>I have a number of invited talks lined up for the next year: speaking about my digital dissertation at Brown and Northeastern universities, about the future of digital editions and annotations on a Folger-sponsored panel at the 2016 Renaissance Society of America conference, and as a speaker at the “Culture Analytics and User Experience Design” workshop at UCLA's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM).</p>

<p>I expect my first year to be a lot of listening, observing, and dialogue toward understanding digital humanities needs on campus. Every campus has its own opportunities (existing archives, projects, interests) and needs, and DH is necessarily focused and inflected differently in every location. Relying on my user testing background, I'm looking forward to discovering both what identified and not-yet-identified DH needs exist at Purdue.</p>

<p>My first year will also see some follow-up work on my recent DH dissertation; my dissertation whitepaper has thick fodder for at least four articles, and I'm working on a public resource for future digital dissertators.</p>

<p>Infinite Ulysses, too, will continue to grow as I now have research time to devote to its development. I've done a huge amount of work on the site locally this summer, and I'm hoping to move those major improvements (prettier! less buggy! talet-friendly!) to the public site in early fall. Additionally, I'll have time to develop Infinite Ulysses into something that better supports collaboration on both Ulysses and annotation, and the technical and design aspects of the site. There are already a few truly excellent and generous regular annotators on the site, and I'll now have time to better showcase and reward these collaborators' work. I'll catch up with a few projects where I'd discussed releasing and documenting my code for use on other digital editions.</p>

<p>I'll get the project to a place where it's easy for someone with any overlapping interest (annotating, scholarly research around Ulysses or modernism, technical work around texts and digital editions) to become a recognized collaborator. Ideally, Infinite Ulysses will provide a way for students and faculty to learn and practice technical skills as well, and eventually have some sort of recurring class, lab, or workshop building off it.</p>

<p>I'll be thinking about ways to offer DH options for graduate students thinking about digital dissertations or alt-ac careers. Given my background with educational alternate reality games (ARGs) focused on STEAM skills and information literacy, I'm also keen to design an ARG class (possibly as a first-year experience course) that gets students involved with Purdue's amazing Early Flight and Space Exploration archive (which contains amazing artifacts from Amelia Earhart and Neil Armstrong, at least one space suit, and has its own "Flight Archivist").</p>

<h2>Models of DH work</h2>
<p>When the Purdue job ad was posted, there was some Twitter discussion of how exciting it was to see a DH ad "doing it right" in terms of responsibility scope and supporting the scholar. I hope that future hiring committees use the ad as a model for more DH roles. In particular, the ad asks for someone with a strong research background *and* also supports the continuation of that research through a faculty appointment, the tenure track, and supporting personal research.</p>

<p>The ad also outlined a collaboration model for DH in the library, rather than a "service shop" model. My experience is that supporting the creation of DH collaborators—investing in people—is the most efficient and powerful approach to creating a DH presence on campus in both the short- and long-run. (I felt so strongly about this that I made it the subject of my job talk—see the related <a href="https://www.zotero.org/amandavisconti/items/collectionKey/4QBG6XU3">Future of DH + Libraries Zotero collection</a> I created for great thinking on this by Miriam Posner, Trevor Munoz, Bethany Nowviskie, and others.)</p>

<h2>Let's talk!</h2>
<p>If you'd like to collaborate on a project, or are seeking someone to speak to your department or class about the practical aspects of pursuing a digital dissertation (at Purdue or anywhere), let me know! I'm on Twitter @Literature_Geek and my email is amandavisconti@gmail.com.</p>
