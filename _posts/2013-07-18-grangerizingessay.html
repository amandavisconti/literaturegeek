<p><a href="http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook//grangerizing.php" >My essay on Grangerizing</a> is up over at the Archbook online encyclopedia on the architectures of the book! <a href="http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook//grangerizing.php" >Check it out here</a>. There was more florid anti-Grangerizing invective than I could fit into the essay, so also check out <a title="Book Ghouls: Grangerizing as Book Hacking’s Black Sheep" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2013/07/book-ghouls-grangerizing-as-book-hackings-black-sheep" >my previous Grangerizing post</a> for more!</p>

<p>Archbook is "is an open-access, peer-reviewed collection of richly illustrated essays about specific design features in the history of the book". Other entries include manicules (yay!), volvelles, and flaps, and they're <a href="http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook/authors.php" >looking for more entries</a> on a variety of book-materiality topics.</p>
