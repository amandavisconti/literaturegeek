<p><a href="http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook//grangerizing.php" target="_blank">My essay on Grangerizing</a> is up over at the Archbook online encyclopedia on the architectures of the book! <a href="http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook//grangerizing.php" target="_blank">Check it out here</a>. There was more florid anti-Grangerizing invective than I could fit into the essay, so also check out <a title="Book Ghouls: Grangerizing as Book Hacking’s Black Sheep" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/book-ghouls-grangerizing-as-book-hackings-black-sheep" target="_blank">my previous Grangerizing post</a> for more!</p>
<p><img alt="Folger Shakespeare Library photo of Grangerized Shakespearean text." src="assets/granger1.jpg" width="300" height="177"></a> Shakespeare's works were popular foundations for grangerizing to commemorate performances, but another frequent type of augmentation—the addition of description and portraits for historically based characters—can be seen in this example from a 1888 copy of The Works of William Shakespeare augmented by Augustin Daly in 1893.

<p>Archbook is "is an open-access, peer-reviewed collection of richly illustrated essays about specific design features in the history of the book". Other entries include manicules (yay!), volvelles, and flaps, and they're <a href="http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook/authors.php" target="_blank">looking for more entries</a> on a variety of book-materiality topics.</p>
