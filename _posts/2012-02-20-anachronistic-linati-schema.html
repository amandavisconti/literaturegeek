<p>Matt Schneider presented an fun thought experiment on his blog* about a year ago: if someone created a <em>Ulysses</em> video game, what technics would we use to parallel the style peculiar to each section of the novel? For Proetus, Matt proposed "First Person Stream-of-consciousness, akin to that seen in Stout Games' IGF nominated <em>Dinner Date</em>"; for Ithaca, a "catechism based on Joseph Weizenbaum's classic ELIZA".</p>
<p>I'm a <em>Ulysses</em> nerd and both a game and textual studies scholar, so I had to jump into the thought experiment. The following are the ideas I've come up with (some of them I brainstormed during a "Literary ARG" session I led at <a href="http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/13/session-proposal-maryland-is-for-gamers">THATCamp Games</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Telemachus: <em>Pikmin.</em> Has that "the day is new" feel, and perhaps you could parallel picking up strange new objects to picking up on Stephen's various preoccupations and annoyances.</li>
<li>Nestor: Some sort of annoying pedantic training sequence. Maybe a <em>Civ(3</em>?) mod that models Ireland vs. England that forces you to sit through a frustratingly superior tutorial first?</li>
<li>Lotus Eaters: Something that rewards you for lazier playing, like <em>Don't Shoot the Puppy</em>?</li>
<li>Sirens: Oh boy. A <em>Guitar Hero/Rock Band</em>/karaoke clone?</li>
<li>Cyclops: Model the Citizen on one of the colossi from <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>?</li>
<li>Nausicaa: ...Japanese dating sim?</li>
<li>Circe: I think a light world/dark world mechanic like that used in <em>Link to the Past</em> or <em>Trilby's Notes</em> might work well towards emphasizing the real/unreal in Circe.</li>
<li>Ithaca: Matching questions and answers a la <em>Monkey Island</em> insult duels.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was time to pull these back here form the comments on Matt's blog, because on Wednesday I'll be expanding on the idea with a "Anachronistic Linati Schema" lesson plan for teaching <em>Ulysses</em>. I'll be substitute-teaching for Professor Brian Richardson's English 428 undergraduate seminar on <em>Ulysses</em>, and since we'll be discussing the "Hades" section (right before THE INELUCTABLE HEADLINES of Aeolus), we're at a good point to stand back and think about how the less-obvious style changes we've encountered so far are both responding to and shaping the narrative. The plan is to share these videogame ideas, then have students choose a media category with which they're familiar (music, movies, books--or even better would be individual games within genres, or subgenres within genres). After putting these up on a grid together, we'll look for similarities among the choices. I'll report back on Wednesday with what we find!</p>
