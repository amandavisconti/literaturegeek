    <p>How do you conduct a speculative experiment around a digital humanities tool, while also creating something that's useful to readers and scholars right now? I've been using a site policy on tagging to test the differences between my speculative design and the probable reality of my site's use.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p>My <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro" >Infinite Ulysses</a> participatory digital edition will let readers and scholars add contextual annotations to James Joyce's Ulysses. Those annotations can be tagged with a word or phrase that will help other readers find their particular signal in the potential noise of a (hypothetically) heavily annotated text; possibilities arising from tagging annotations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>filtering the annotations to only show those on particular areas of interest (e.g. annotations that translate foreign words, or annotations aimed at first-time readers)</li>
<li>filtering <em>out</em> annotations the reader doesn't want to see (e.g. spoilers about something that only becomes clear later in the book)</li>
<li>easily creating a curated "edition" of Ulysses aimed at a specific topic (e.g. an edition meant for use by a class focusing on the place of books, letters, newspapers, and other written material in the Modernist novel)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ulysses' complexity and hypertextuality make it a great candidate for extension through intense annotation, and I've <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro" >written previously</a> about scholarly concerns over what heavy contextual annotation and interpretation would do to the text: two circumstances that make Ulysses perfect for a speculative experiment (An approach that can learn about an object such as a digital edition by imagining and designing for a hypothetical and/or future circumstance) in designing a digital edition with thousands of users actively creating content (annotations, questions/answers) on the site, and generally using the features of the site to their limit.</p>
<p><strong>So: tagged annotations, and a site designed to customize a large amount of noise so that each reader receives the signal he or she requires.</strong> How can I make this tagging actually work—both in my speculative experiment hypothetical of thousands of active site users, and in the more realistic possibility of far less activity?</p>
<h2>Building for Two Extremes of Site Usage</h2>
<p>I see two possible routes for tag creation: restricting users to a limited set of tags I provide myself (perhaps supplemented with user-created tags by specific request), or allowing users to create and apply their own tags that become part of the public pool of available tags (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy" >a folksonomy</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Trust the users to find how tags serve them best: </strong>I start from the premise that allowing users more control over their reading experience provides them with a more customized reading experience, a major goal of the site. I'd prefer to model what I see as appropriate use of tags, and then assume users will employ the feature in a way that benefits their reading and, by extension, that of other users (even if not in the way I expected). From my experiences dealing with spam and observing internet trolling, though, I'll have a plan in place for moderation of tags before they join the public pool, if early use of the site suggests a need for it (and I assume I'll need some sort of anti-spam tactics, although requiring user accounts and IP banning will be of some help in preventing spammers and allowing real users more freedom).</p>
<h3>So Much Annotation Tagging!</h3>
<p>With my <strong>speculative experiment</strong> hat on, allowing users to build an unbridled folksonomy of thousands of tags sounds like problems: too many tags for moderation by one dissertating graduate student, redundant tags with slightly different spellings or phrasings, and an overwhelming list of possible tags for the user to select from are all possible problems. For a site dealing with extreme amounts of user-generated content, good approaches to moderation draw on the user community (e.g. as in asking users to click a "flag as inappropriate/spam" button when spam is encountered).</p>
<p>I admire <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/" >StackExchange's approach to moderation</a> (I'm also thinking about incorporating StackExchange's feed of unanswered questions into the site—a quick way to see parts of the text you might help another person with, and a way to generate "reputation" points toward a user undergoing less moderation and more automatically public content), which requires site users to build up "reputation" points through successively more broader site privileges. These privileges range from users who have contributed very little to the site being limited to actions such as flagging posts, to those who have performed enough "reputable" actions on the site being allowed moderator-like abilities such as casting deletion votes on negatively voted answers.</p>
<p>Because I don't want users to have any waiting time before jumping into using the site, I'd need to modify StackExchange's approach so that new users have a full range of user abilities from the very start—but whether annotations and answers they create are visible to the public could be dependent on their site activity (time spent on the site, indicating reading) and/or their contributions (one decent annotation = probably not a spammer). I'd also allow users to create opt-in groups of users who can see their annotations regardless of whether they're visible to the general public, allowing users such as literature classes or book clubs to work together with no delay.</p>
<h3>A Reasonable Amount of Annotation Tagging?</h3>
<p>In <strong>reality</strong>, the site won't generate that extreme level of content described by my speculative experiment. Anecdotal evidence from other <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/" >Speaking in Code</a> attendees suggests that site users creating too many tags won't be an issue; the more likely reality (as with any DH project) is that your project doesn't see enough visitors turn into site users, or enough site users actively adding content (such as new tags) to your site.</p>
<p>Less site use than my speculative extreme is good, because I can design a site that draws on StackExchange's and Reddit's communal moderation, while putting into place a policy that relies on content generation being low enough that I can moderate it if needed (with the help of a "flag for moderation" option for users). The site is built around the idea of communal discussion of Ulysses, and I'd much rather need to moderate public content after it's been posted, then place any delay on a user sharing his thoughts with the community. The StackExchange approach, while great for professionals who have a reason to return to the site and build up reputation, doesn't work quite as well for a DH project where any barrier to entry might turn away potential readers.</p>
<p>I'll be gathering statistics (e.g. "Community Transcription — Thirty-One Months" <a href="http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?p=1442" >http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?p=1442</a>) and noting design decisions on other crowdsourcing projects over the coming month, with an emphasis on crowdsourcing that requires active user decision-making or interpretation. Crowdsourcing that specifically asks for little active attention on the part of the user is a great place to learn about intuitive design, though. <a href="https://twitter.com/POrg" >Peter Organisciak</a>'s recent blog post "<a href="http://crowdresearch.org/blog/?p=8320" >CrowdCamp Report: Waitsourcing, approaches to low-effort crowdsourcing</a>" prototypes several crowdsourcing instruments that demonstrate useful ways of lowering effort for user participation, suggesting some novel ways of asking users to help with annotation tags (e.g. I could separate tagging into a feed as with the unanswered questions, or place a small widget in the footer of the site that pulls up an untagged annotation and asks for a tag... unclear whether those would be useful or used, but food for thought).</p>
<p>At the end of the <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro">Infinite Ulysses</a> project, I expect to address each site feature (e.g. annotation tagging) across three contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>precedents from other DH projects (e.g. how tagging moderation was addressed, the amount of tagging users actually supplied)</li>
<li>the statistical realities of my site, observed via user studies (how often was moderation required? how many tags did users actually apply to annotations?)</li>
<li>what designing the site with a speculative experiment in mind teaches me about the limits of digital editions</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Blended Approach to Tags</h2>
<p>My current thinking is to take a blended approach to tags: seed the Infinite Ulysses site with contextual annotations before opening it for public viewing, and also seed those annotations with tags (Tags will link to page with a paragraph providing more information about the tag (for user-provided tags, these might need to be created by me?).) from a small set of broadly useful ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each foreign language that appears in the text (church Latin, French...)</li>
<li>Literary references (e.g. Milton, Shakespeare's specific plays)</li>
<li>Clues (e.g. to the identity of Bloom's correspondent and Macintosh)</li>
<li>Spoilers (annotations drawing on information you'd only know if you'd already read the book)</li>
<li>Vocabulary (help with difficult words, the history and contemporary uses of particular phrases or slang)</li>
<li>Music (making it easy to pull up references to song, lyrics, poetry in the text)</li>
<li>Simple and advanced plot explanations (can be toggled off for those not interested in this help)</li>
<li>Reading media (references to books, newsprint, letters)</li>
<li>Colonialism and usurpation</li>
<li>Some sort of tagging that indicates the granularity of an annotation, so that annotations appropriate for scholars versed in interpretations of the book reach them, and annotations helpful to a first-time-reader understanding of the book reach those users (suggested by <a href="http://twitter.com/Yellworque" >Ronan Crowley</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Users will be free to add their own tags, but I'll keep a close eye on site usee during user testing and decide whether those user-created tags will be automatically public, visible only to the user who created them until I moderate them, or start as private but automatically appear publicly once the user has proven understanding of site use with some small level of activity on the site (<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/" >the StackExchange approach</a>). When I begin user-testing, I'll have a chance to ask users what their preference is and see how tagging might actually play out; I'm excited for my users to show me which option is best for them!</p>

        Infinite Ulysses: Usability Personas and Site Content Ideas

    <p>I'm starting to flesh out the <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro">Infinite Ulysses</a> site's content: pages explaining my methodology, how to use the site, etc. Eventually, I'll be thinking about how I want people to progress through the site (by creating and walking through the site in several example user personas and how they'll probably actually use the site (arrive and want to jump right in to reading the text and using the features).</p>
<p>For the latter (most likely) case, I'll probably offer a short (60 seconds or less) video tutorial on setting up an account and using all the features of the site, as well as an option that walks you through one way of using the site (probably something like <a href="http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/building" >how NYPL Labs introduces users to their Building Inspector site</a>). I'll need to figure out how to balance people who want to jump right into site use via intuitive design of the various features, and encouraging site visitors to take five minutes and learn the site's full capabilities before using it. Those visitors who actually end up reading some or all of <em>Ulysses</em> on the site will be spending a lot of time on it, so it's worth their while to know all the features available to them—but it will be my job to convince them of that (and make the features worthy of their use).</p>
<h2><strong>Usability Testing and Site Visitor Personas</strong></h2>
<p>I'm not at the point of testing the site via personas yet, but I've started to record feedback from various people I've talked with about my projects with an eye toward the personas' eventual creation. A <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html" >usability persona</a> is a representation of a potential user group for your website, based on real feedback and condensed into a single representative fictional character against which you can test the site experience. I've given my initial personas silly names to help me quickly step through these four approaches to site use whenever I'm considering a new feature:</p>
<ul id="docs-internal-guid-62083738-cad2-c155-8675-fd852dff0faa">
<li >Riley Read-Everything (a user who wants to go through all the background info on the site before committing to reading, who needs a clear architecture for reading through the various non-<em>Ulysses</em> pages on the site)</li>
<li >Jessie Jump-Right-In (a first-time reader of <em>Ulysses </em>who jumps right into reading and annotating and asking questions, requiring intuitively designed site functionality)</li>
<li >Taylor the Teacher (a user orchestrating group work on <em>Ulysses</em>, possibly with private annotations or other teaching/book club requirements)</li>
<li >Sam the Scholar (a user with some <em>Ulysses </em>experience who wants to help out by adding contextual annotations and answering questions, perhaps by adding a bulk list of their existing annotations; and/or wants to understand and engage in scholarly uses of the site such as curating a themed/argument-making set of annotations)</li>
</ul>
<p>The persona walkthroughs will be followed by real site use and usability testing, first with a small group of friends and colleagues (which will help me create an updated set of usability personas), then with a limited beta testing group, and finally with the site open to everyone.</p>
<h2>Potential Site Content</h2>
<p>A developing list of content for informational pages I'll probably want to publish on the Infinite Ulysses site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspired by <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/#inclusivity" >the Speaking in Code inclusivity statement</a>, a statement of welcome encouraging participation by everyone, with a contact form for suggestions on how the site can better its users. This page will also address the positive rights of the site users, such as the site being a safe space to ask questions (however simple) and to provide answers from any viewpoint, and a clear path for reporting any issues within the site user community.</li>
<li>User profile pages (for finding active readers on the site who have similar interests or backgrounds, for recording demographics on the site user base, etc.)</li>
<li>An explanation of copyrights and other licensing active on the site (what rights do users maintain over content shared with the site? what licenses have I applied to my written content, code, and design?)</li>
<li>Background material on Joyce and the writing of Ulysses (e.g. Ulysses' legal history, versions of the work from drafts onward)</li>
<li>Development blog (with a timeline, of site work new features, bugs fixed, questions for existing users)</li>
<li>A support forum (intended for questions about site usage and bug reporting; postings that are questions about the text may be lifted to the textual annotations)</li>
<li>An explanation of the core set of tags I'm providing when the site opens for public use (what they mean, who they may be useful to, why I included them, how to add your own)</li>
<li>Future plans for the site, with a poll on possible future features of the site</li>
<li>Contact page</li>
<li>Unanswered queue: questions about the text that haven't received an answer are pulled onto this page so that it's easier for me and other site users to help one another out in their interpretations</li>
<li>A page describing the accessibility/universal design work done on the site, future plans for greater accessibility, and a form for suggesting other tactics</li>
<li>How to use the mobile version of the site</li>
<li>How to use the site in the classroom to teach <em>Ulysses </em>(how to let students privately annotate the text and have that work only visible to their teacher; how to let students curate their own themed digital edition version of the text)</li>
<li>How to use the site in reading groups (e.g. book clubs)</li>
<li>How to add annotations to the site in bulk (i.e. if you have a list or file of Ulysses annotations for some reason and wish to add them to the text without typing them in one by one)</li>
<li>An explanation of annotation moderation policy (e.g. I reserve the right to unpublish or delete content that is spam, defamatory, or otherwise not supportive of the goals of the project. Whenever the possibility of the content being added to the site in good faith is present, I will contact the author of the content upon unpublishing and either give them a few days to copy their content from the site before I delete it, or send them a copy of the content.)</li>
<li>Information on my digital humanities and Joyce studies backgrounds, as well as my interests and biases as they effect interpretation of <em>Ulysses</em> and design of digital editions</li>
</ul>

    <p>Who holds the intellectual property (IP) rights to your digital dissertation? In my case, the answer is complicated, involving multiple licenses and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Digital humanities productions brings new licensing concerns to the humanities. Our pre-digital discussions around IP usually centered around book contracts and open-access journals; rights claims from any agency that funds you during the production of a scholarly work might affect where you can publish or what types of acknowledgement you must include, but I'm assuming such agreements rarely control the reuse or extension of that work the way licensing for code, design, and digital content does. Digital humanities dissertations are an interesting case, given that they are usually "authored" by one person (although they may benefit from just as much collaborative support from librarians, faculty, and other academic mentors as any other scholarly endeavor), not completed while on the clock for a job, and may be supported funding from multiple sources, with a variety of IP stakes in your work.</p>
<p>For my <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities doctoral dissertation</a>'s <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">Infinite Ulysses</a> project, I'm building off open-source code from a variety of sources: the community of Drupal developers, a tech non-profit, and a grant-funded initiative (<a href="http://editingmodernism.ca" >Editing Modernism in Canada</a>) that is also providing a fellowship supporting a year of my dissertational work. In drafting an IP agreement for this project, I needed to think both about the rights I want to assert for the code (Drupal modules), design (Drupal themes), and content (written annotations, tutorials, etc. appearing on my sites) I create, <em>and</em> my continued access to code created by others (e.g. after the end of the fellowship, would I have access to updated versions of code from my funder?).</p>
<p>I'd like to think that good faith keeps DH informational exchanges smooth and that IP agreements—especially for projects like dissertations—will never need to act as real shields. On the other hand, digital projects have an unfortunate history of not being correctly attributed; digital archives are consulted but not cited, or a digital object is used but the (unused) print version is cited. Good working relationships with funders or departments aren't a shield against pressure for commercial gains from higher up in a university or organization, or different ideas about intellectual property when an organization shifts into new hands. Being clear on the IP status of the different pieces of your digital dissertation is good practice, even if it's only an exercise to help you think about licensing future, larger projects.</p>
<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>Off the top of my head, I can think of twelve forms of information I'm dealing with in my <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities doctoral dissertation</a>'s <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">Infinite Ulysses</a> project, with varied IP licensing:</p>
<h3>Information I'm creating:</h3>
<p>1. Posts about the project appearing on my personal research blog (<a title="Home" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/">LiteratureGeek.com;</a> the site is marked "CC BY-NC unless otherwise specified")</p>
<p>2. Content blogged or cross-posted to the <a href="http://editingmodernism.ca/community/" >EMiC blog</a> (unclear)</p>
<p>3. Contextual annotations, questions, and answers affixed to the text of Ulysses, created by me (almost definitely some flavor of Creative Commons license)</p>
<p>4. Infinite Ulysses site content (e.g. tutorials, about page text, etc.; possibly rights reserved, possibly CC0 if I want to go the whole way with the idea that anyone should be able to completely replicate my work)</p>
<p>5. Marketing/outreach materials (e.g. tweets, stickers, videos; some flavor of Creative Commons license )</p>
<h3><strong>Information created by others:</strong></h3>
<p>6. The <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/portfolio/ulysses-shakespeare-co-1922-1st-edn/" >CC-licensed MVP Ulysses text</a> (digitized by Matthew Kochis and Patrick Belk of the University of Tulsa; CC BY-NC-SA 3.0; production funded by one or more grants)</p>

Contextual annotations, questions, answers, profile information, and any other content an Infinite Ulysses site visitor or account-holder might input to the site (site use agrees to a CC license, possibly CC0; there may be an option to keep a site account-holder's inputs private from the public but not from me, limiting the possibility of bad-faith commercial reuse)</p>
<p>12. Input from user-testing surveys (users agree to CC0 on anonymized answers)</p>
<p>As with any scholarly project, I'm building on the work of others and putting my work out for reuse—leading to many types of information and information licensing.</p>
<p>I've been thinking seriously about using CC0 whenever it's a possibility, because of the chilling effect on reuse and remixing caused by a potential user needing to navigate unfamiliar or varied licensing demands. CC0 is the Creative Commons license that releases information into the public domain <em>without</em> limiting requirements such as attribution to the creator (BY), sharing any remixed/reused information under the same license as the original (share alike, or SA), or prohibiting commercial reuse (NC). Some form of CC or other free-reuse-allowing license is necessary if I actually want for someone to hypothetically duplicate my work.</p>
<h2>The University and IP Rights</h2>
<p>Your university almost definitely has a policy on the licensing of intellectual property created by students and staff, so you'll want to check it out early in your project and be certain that your rights are what you think they are; preferably, get a written acknowledgment from your university's IP office or lawyer that you can file in case questions arise later on. My <a href="http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/docs/IV-320A.pdf" >university's IP policy</a> is a bit unclear in my particular situation; generally, students retain rights over code created during a dissertation, but there is a clause suggesting that a student having a "written agreement" related to the dissertation with some other party might negate those rights. Does applying for and receiving an academic fellowship that partially supports a year of the dissertation count as a "written agreement"? I decided to check now instead of having trouble later, but after six weeks of emails (including several times reminding the tech IP office that they hadn't given me a response), I sent a final email identifying a deadline I'd need to hear from them by, or I'd consider my rights retained. That deadline passed with no word from the IP office. I'm really not expecting there to be any issues; it's not like the site will be generating money or I'll be creating something that someone else will use to make money, but it's still nice to have that chain of emails for the record.</p>
<h2>Creative Commons? CC Zero?</h2>
<p>Creative Commons (CC) licenses are not appropriate for executed code; they weren't developed with software in mind and don't mention executable code in their language (CC actually <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_software.3F" >recommends against</a> using its licenses for software). <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data#Can_databases_be_released_under_CC_licenses.3F" >CC licenses <em>can</em> be used on databases</a>, but you should <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data#When_a_CC_license_is_applied_to_a_database.2C_what_is_being_licensed.3F" >read about exactly what of a database is being protected</a>.</p>
<p>For information that can be appropriately licensed by CC, digital humanists <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by/" >Bethany Nowviskie</a> and <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2013/11/26/cc0-by/" >Dan Cohen</a> have both written convincing arguments for licensing your work using CC0, aka CC Zero (CC0 is the Creative Commons license that releases information into the public domain without limiting requirements such as attribution to the creator (BY), sharing any remixed/reused information under the same license as the original (share alike, or SA), or prohibiting commercial reuse (NC) ). Their arguments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the humanities, there isn't a huge risk of our work being reused for nefarious commercial profit (although the rise of MOOCs may change that); the real risk is of never being read/used, so make it easy for your work to be remixed, extended, and spread</li>
<li>people who would reuse your work in bad faith will probably do so regardless of your licensing choice</li>
<li>forcing the potential reuser/remixer/extender to deal with a bewildering array of different licenses has a chilling effect on beneficial reuse or extension of your work</li>
</ul>
<p>Dan Cohen advocates for using CC0 while also providing guidance in terms of best practices for your information's use (e.g. attribution isn't required by law, but it's a nice and useful thing to do). The <a href="http://dp.la" >Digital Public Library of America</a> (DPLA) offers <a href="http://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DPLADataUseBestPractices.pdf" >a good example of an information best practices statement</a>; you might use the DPLA's to model a similar (possibly shorter, given the size of your project) set of guidelines for use of your information. For my Infinite Ulysses site, I'll probably write a page showing how to attribute each type of the site's content and suggesting some ways of reusing and extending my work.</p>
