        "Electronic Literature after Flash": Weirding Credible Digital Platforms to Tell Stories
      </a>

    <p><em>"The slow death of Flash also leaves a host of [e-lit] authors who can no longer create in their chosen medium. It’s as if a novelist were told that she could no longer use a word processor—indeed, no longer even use words. Or is it?"</em></p>
<p>I'm pleased to be part of Mark Sample's MLA '14 roundtable proposal, "Electronic Literature after Flash". You can <a href="/2013/04/11/elitafterflash" >read the whole proposal</a> over on Mark's blog (which, incidentally, has just a lot of great writing about DH and about teaching as scholarship)--I'll be joining a group of both e-lit scholars and authors: Mark, Leo Flores, Chris Funkhouser, Dene Grigar, Mark Marino, Stuart Moulthrop, and Zach Whalen.</p>
<p>Here's the chunk on my part of the roundtable:</p>
<p>Amanda Visconti surveys the way e-lit can appropriate digital platforms that were never designed for poetics or narrative. Visconti argues that such platform poaching combines the veneer of credibility associated with a digital archive or a wiki with a narrative license that is simultaneously ethically dangerous and rich with possibilities for counterfactual knowledge.</p>
<p>I want to discuss the ethics and possibilities of e-lit’s distorting occupation of platforms intended for other uses—more specifically, to start a conversation about the mindful misuse of academic or similarly  “credible” platforms. E-lit built off social media frameworks (e.g. <a href="http://www.urban3zero.com">The Urban 30</a>, the <a href="http://laflood.citychaos.com">LA Flood project</a>), while not always immediately recognizable as fictional, at least carries with it our awareness of the biases and misinformation of news and gossip. Combining the veneer of credibility associated with a digital archive or wiki framework with narrative license is a tactic both ethically dangerous and rich with possibilities for ‘patacritical and counterfactual knowledges. I’ll briefly outline a few such e-lit appropriations and warpings of credible platforms, such as the speculative but factually grounded Anglish Moot constructed language wiki and the counterfactually half-true eduARG <em>The Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry</em>’s historical wiki, as well as mention a few platforms ripe for creative misuse. This lightning talk should provoke discussion about the ethics of e-lit, weirding existing platforms, and the role of e-lit in communicating factual knowledge.</p>

    <p><em>I successfully defended my <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities doctoral dissertation</a> in Spring 2015. The now-available <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">Infinite Ulysses</a> social+digital reading platform is part of that project; <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">come read with us</a>!</em></p>

<p>Scholarly editor Gary Taylor has asked (And I have requoted just about every month) : “How can you love a work, if you don't know it? How can you know it, if you can't get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” Scholarly editors are an integral part of the continuum that keeps the stories of the past available to and understood by the present—but just as important in Taylor’s formulation is the <em>you</em>, that public of not just scholars, but also readers beyond the academy whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant. <strong>I intend to build tools and digital editions that help everyone—textual scholars and the lay person—participate in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning.</strong> We need to rethink the structure—the look and behavior—of our most foundational form, the scholarly edition, looking to the full possibilities of the digital (and not just those that approximate traditional codex form) in order to see a more public textual studies—a textual studies that encourages participation outside of a limited circle of expertise, using games and ludic approaches, provocations to deeper thinking, visual design, and visual knowledge to share our intelligence about and passion for book studies more widely.</p>
<p>As researchers, we feel the urgency of a more publicly understood and useful humanities: convincing the public of our worth ties into how we are funded, but even more importantly, our ability to argue convincingly for our worth to non-specialists requires us to have an understanding of our studies so clear that it can be rendered into simple language. Teaching is knowing:</p>
<p  style="padding-left: 30px;">[Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman] prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, 'Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.' Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, 'I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it.' But he came back a few days later to say, 'I couldn't do it. <strong>I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don't really understand it.</strong>' (David L. Goodstein, in <em>Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun</em>)</p>
<p>Human-computer interaction, a field focused on interfaces between user and computer (including interfaces of reading and research), provides a useful approach to a humanities that simultaneously benefits the public and scholars: participatory design.<strong> Participatory design</strong> is an approach not just centered on the scholar or just on the public, but finessing the “third space” of discussion and shared learning that exists when the two groups come into conversation; results can include “challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal (many-voiced) dialogues across and through differences“ (Muller, Michael J. "Participatory Design: The Third Space in HCI". In <em>The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook</em>. 1051-1068.). When we bring the public into our scholarly conversations, everyone benefits; designing for interactive participation and pedagogy is a scholarly activity that also benefits the public.</p>
<p>In my participatory design approach to digital edition interfaces, <a title="Living Editions: What Seminars Can Teach Us About Building Digital Editions" href="/2012/11/06/livingeditions" >I draw on my own positive experiences in graduate literary seminars, in the belief that we can build scholarly digital editions that model two of the most rewarding aspects of a good class</a>: communal enjoyment and communal knowledge of a text. A well-run seminar gets participants excited about the subtleties of a text, regardless of how remote its language or voice or subject matter might be from their own lives; a well-run seminar also results in everyone, teacher as well as students, gaining new insight into a literary text. As I experiment with the nature of digital editions, textual materiality, and other scholarly questions, I believe I can at the same time imagine digital editions as ideal communal spaces of literary conversation where scholars and public can learn from one another.</p>
<p>This dissertation addresses a gap in humanities knowledge: the digital edition, like the print edition before it, is developing into a key form of scholarly textual presentation, yet the advances in the past thirty years of textual studies have mostly focused on three areas of study to the exclusion of other knowledge: the development of a standard for encoding text (the Text Encoding Initiative), the development of archives presenting well-encoded text and textual images alongside tools for searching and inspecting these (e.g. The William Blake Archive), and theorizing possibilities for textual studies in digital spaces without making major changes to digital editions in concert with these theories (e.g. Jerome McGann’s <em>Radiant Textuality: Literature after the World Wide Web</em>). To fill out the first two areas of study, we need to study in real scholarly situations how that encoded text, and those powerful but now fairly standard tools, are actually used and how they might be improved; to capitalize on the third area of study, we need to build these theories into our digital editions such that their innovative arguments are obvious to new users and empirically testable via user studies. There are some very good reasons why user-awareness isn't more prevalent in DH and in digital editions in particular (e.g. funding and grant time constraints, lack of example metrics to build off), and I'll be addressing these as well as throwing in my bit of DH user studies work for the next practitioner to build on. I'll also be discussing some recent and important work innovating the interfaces of our digital editions, such as <a href="http://www.tapasproject.org" >the TAPAS project</a> (trying to open all that lovingly encoded text to remix and reuse for research and teaching), <a href="http://inke.ca/projects/tools-and-prototypes/" >various INKE initiatives</a> (especially Jon Saklofske's <a href="http://inke.acadiau.ca/newradial/" >NewRadial</a> work imagining new entries into the Blake Archive), and Alan Galey's <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/index.html" >Visualizing Variation</a> code sets, all of which incorporate a laudable awareness of the broad end use and reading experience of editions.</p>

    <p>How do scholars interface with digital editions of literature, and how can we improve the appearance and behavior of digital edition interfaces to not only better support current scholarly use, but predict and create new ways of reading, teaching, and learning about texts? With my literature doctoral dissertation, titled <em>“How Can You Love a Text, If You Don’t Know It?”</em> (As you might know if you read this blog, just my favorite pro-editing quotation: "How can you love a work, if you don't know it? How can you know it, if you can't get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?" - Gary Taylor, "The Renaissance and the End of Editing", in Palimpsest: Textual Theory and the Humanities, ed. George Bornstein and Ralph G. Williams (1993), 121-50.) <em>: Critical Code and Design toward Participatory Digital Editions</em>, I'm coding and designing scholarly tools, interfaces, and games that value:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>building-as-making</strong>: instead of the traditional monograph, employ and extend theory in the form of tools that can actually empirically test that theory</li>
<li><strong>speculative design</strong>: push our scholarly tools further by creating solutions for the future (e.g. a digital edition that attracts thousands of public participants)</li>
<li><strong>user-testing, participatory design, and the public humanities</strong>: in the beliefs that teaching is knowing and it makes for a better world to share knowledge, build on <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380" >my master's thesis user study of public use of scholarly digital archives</a> to create digital humanities tools that are useful to both scholars and lay-persons; we need to do a better job sharing our passion for the intricacies of our cultural heritage and present with the public</li>
<li><strong>games and play</strong>: "Games are unnecessary obstacles that we choose to tackle", says games researcher Jane McGonigal--and so are difficult texts; think about games as models of critical learning behavior; build our rich history of literary play and gaming into our digital edition toolkit, thinking about <em>Ivanhoe</em>, the Oulipo, design fiction, communal storytelling, textual intervention, narrative alternate reality games, and video-game modding</li>
<li><strong>graphesis and the whole book</strong>: grant the same acknowledgement of knowledge-containing visuals we do to our literary objects of study (e.g. Blake's image-texts) to their meta-texts (editions) by incorporating critical graphic design; dream big about conveying the whole book to remote researchers, not just linguistic content and 2D images</li>
<li><strong>modeling reading and editing practices</strong>: if scholarly interpretation is a conversation, then model our digital editions on participatory exemplars of reading like online communities (e.g. Reddit) and the best graduate seminar experiences; teach people "how to think like an editor" to discover how editors' own theories develop</li>
<li><strong>leveraging something old on something new</strong>: by migrating and extending a prescient Victorian edition prototype and its design values to digital space, explore the affordances, limits, and possibilities of both the print and digital pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital editions are texts presented according to some critical ideal in digital space. We need to know more about how this scholarly form is used so that we can build sites that fully communicate and preserve literary texts, from the written word on the page to the iconic codes and materiality of the whole book, and so that we can in turn use digital editions as better platforms for inquiry into the nature of complex textual objects. <strong>I propose to build textual forms to understand them</strong>, creating three digital edition interfaces that separately explore the textual behaviors of reading, teaching, and research. One project will explore the social experience of critical <strong>reading</strong>, exploring whether a difficult Modernist text (<em></em><em>Ulysses</em>) becomes “normalized” or “diminished” by moving to the center of a public annotation, interpretation, and conversation, and how we might curate the information overload of a vibrantly active digital edition reader/commentator base. Another project treats <strong>teaching</strong> as knowing, using a gamic digital framework for the teaching of editing as a tool for tracing the development of textual scholarship theory and opinion. A third project assesses the whole use a scholar in a physical archive might make of a codex and imagines how we might use digital affordances, such as linkable metadata and 3D models, to bring a less partial simulation of the whole book to remote <strong>research</strong>ers. All three of these interface projects will be built around specific exemplar texts that push the boundaries of modeling via digital edition, texts that challenge both scholar and reader with a multiplicity of meanings (e.g. James Joyce’s notoriously multilayered <em>Ulysses</em>) or that manifestly cannot be fully communicated by current digital edition formats (e.g. the rich design of a <a title="Recovering Teena Rochfort-Smith: Complex Edition Prototype, Female Victorian Editor" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/12/recovering-teena-rochfort-smith-complex-edition-prototype-female-victorian-editor/" >presciently-hypertextual Victorian edition of <em>Hamlet</em></a>). By building digital edition interfaces that employ and extend current textual theory, this dissertation will advance our understanding of how a key scholarly form creates knowledge around texts.</p>
<h3 >Studying our meta-texts by building.</h3>
<p>Textual studies concerns itself with the study of the history, forms, and whole content (from the linguistic to the material) of texts; digital textual scholarship, as a narrower discipline, focuses specifically on the preparation of such texts for scholarly use via a digital space. To push the current research, reading, and teaching abilities of the digital edition further, we need to not just theorize on paper what needs to be changed about editions—it is necessary that we make these theorized changes to digital editions through web design and code work, then critically assess what our interventions teach us about the texts of these digital editions, the form of digital editions in general, and about literary research and teaching in digital spaces. This dissertation proposes to take a step back from the specific literary texts prepared by textual scholars—and a step forward from the purely-written theorizing of other textual studies researchers—to create tools that explore the critical efficacy and possibilities of that increasingly quintessential meta-textual form, the digital edition.</p>
<h3 >Three coding projects as scholarly experiments.</h3>
<p>Blake textual scholar Morris Eaves conceives of editions not just as vessels for textual content, but as “problem-solving mechanisms”; within my broader exploration of the future of digital edition interfaces, I will focus on several specific problems in the form of three digital coding projects, best expressed by my tweets from earlier today:</p>
