        Living Editions: What Seminars Can Teach Us About Building Digital Editions
      </a>

    <p><strong>"In the humanities, what we produce is narrative, and that narrative comes out of experiences of reading.</strong>" <em>- <a href="http://www.joguldi.com" >Jo Guldi</a>, spoken comment at the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/topicmodeling/" >Topic Modeling Workshop</a> at MITH on November 3, 2012</em></p>
<p>My private shorthand for what I want to do with digital editions is "make them like a seminar".</p>
<p>That's not the only or best way of thinking about digital editions; for a start, editions are also conceptualized as:</p>
<ul>
<li>vessels for the centuries-old work of interpreting documents and what they say about the larger text they participate in,</li>
<li>pedagogy,</li>
<li>cultural preservation,</li>
<li>the remixing of multiply useful documents to create new texts for research and reading,</li>
<li>useful substitutes for artifacts you can't physically access (Tanselle, G. Thomas. <em>A Rationale of Textual Criticism</em>.), and</li>
<li>a way of reading (McGann, Jerome. "Ulysses as Postmodern Text: The Gabler Edition".<em> Criticism</em> 27.3: 1985. 283-305.).</li>
</ul>
<p>I try to use the phrase "digital editions" instead of "digital editing" to emphasize that I'm talking about a broader DH activity than traditional or text-level editing. These are choices of project and web design that inflect the form of the edition as a text in its own right, an interpretive, critical activity sometimes called "interfacing". "Digital edition" as meta-text to "editing"'s text, if you will. As my work is focused on our interfacing and behavior with the form of the edition (values that take concrete form with code such as CSS and PHP), I naturally gravitate toward a metaphor foregrounding the edition as a tool of <strong>communication</strong> of interpretive knowledge and connected skills, one that aspires to <strong>a wider audience of users</strong> than the traditional humanist monograph. That "wider audience of users" means that some of the approaches I'll discuss will be less aimed at seasoned scholars of a text than new readers–but many of these approaches can help provoke new knowledge for readers at any level of intimacy with a text.</p>
<p>So: if a digital edition can be like a seminar, what do I mean by "seminar"? I'm usually thinking about graduate seminars as these have been my best in-class experiences, but we might apply lessons from any class-like meeting where a high percentage of the learners are self-motivated and ready to contribute new learning to the class, but benefit from the content, structure, and guidance provided by the instructor. Seminar as the give-and-take opposite to lecturing's delivery and reception of information.</p>
<p>In a digital edition, the parallel is between the edition's team of creators (editors, designers, project developers) and its audience. There's been good discussion of developing more meaningful crowd-sourcing for editions over the past few years (e.g. the Scholars' Lab's Praxis Program and their <a href="http://prism.scholarslab.org/pages/about" >Prism tool</a>, which harnesses "collective interpretive energy"), a movement away from treating our audience as students in a lecture (who mainly receive our polished work) or as free labor (for tasks that may be interesting but that require rote transcription rather than interpretive thinking and input of new ideas). The seminar metaphor understands that one party (the instructor/editors) has a privileged position to the project and its main content areas, but that their role is not only to impart information but scaffold and accept new knowledge and intellectual contributions from the other party (the students/edition users).</p>
<p>My last seminar before achieving candidacy was was Dr. Neil Fraistat's <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/category/spring-2012/" >Technoromanticism</a> (You can read my <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/author/amanda-visconti/" >series of posts about the class</a> or just my post about one of the times I group-taught the class <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/elit/" >here</a>.), a class that I now realize was a living edition of Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em>, and that used many approaches I'd like to see in digital editions. By <strong>living edition</strong>, I want to point at not just the excellently planned <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/syllabus/" >syllabus</a>, which structured our developing conversations about whole and hacked technologies of memory and imagination, monstrosity and virtual realities, always building on previous readings and conversations–but also the class itself, students and teacher:</p>
<h2>Five Approaches from the Technoro Seminar That Digital Editions Could Employ More Regularly:</h2>
<p><em><strong>1a. Seminar Experience:</strong></em> Technoro quickly had the seminar participants coming to class reporting sightings of our Romantic texts still breathing in the real world, whether that meant the image of Frankenstein's monster in <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/the-colonial-subject-as-frankenstein/" >colonial attitudes toward the Irish</a>, or <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/bioshock-and-frankenstein-another-modern-prometheus/" >Nigel Lepianka's connection</a> of the videogame <em>Bioshock</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em>'s "Modern Prometheus" motif.</p>
<p><em><strong>1b. Edition Take-away:</strong> </em>Explore not just your key content, but the boundaries of each text's discourse field. A digital edition that pulls in examples of the text's reception history provides the user with ways to trace themselves back to the world of its writing as well as gauge the ways a text still influences today's world.</p>
<p><em><strong>2a. Seminar Experience:</strong></em> The Technoro class brought in many voices with diverse practical and theoretical relationships to course motifs such as hacking and prosthetics of memory; in addition to the core of literature Ph.D. and M.A. students, students' academic positionings included theater, creative writing, education, cognitive science, and circuitry.</p>
<p><em><strong>2b. Edition Take-away:</strong>  </em>I'd like to see digital editions do a better job incorporating the diverse voices and knowledges of their users. We need better ways of moderating, categorizing, and retrieving annotations from users with many different backgrounds; one decided area of my dissertation is a plan to address this issue via coding and design work, a project currently codenamed "Infinite Ulysses" (More on my dissertation plans soon!). And while we're talking about diversity, let's not forget to try designing our digital editions to be universally accessible (e.g. to screen readers).</p>
<p><strong><em></em><em><strong>3a. Seminar Experience:</strong></em> </strong><strong></strong>For <a href="/2012/04/19/how-can-you-love-a-work-if-you-dont-know-it-six-lessons-from-team-markup" >my Technoro group project</a>, I got to lead a group of students through learning and applying technical skills (Github for markup workflow, TEI encoding) that helped us think about the materiality and transmission history of our key text, <em>Frankenstein</em>, while learning to think like editors about page-level textual issues.</p>
<p><strong><em><strong>3b. Edition Take-away:</strong></em> </strong>Don't obscure the digital structures of your meta-text (the edition framework) by only paying attention to the materiality of the text your edition surrounds. Document decisions about project development and editing methodology using accessible language, and don't efface the human realities behind this work; record both failures and triumphs. If on top of that your edition is able to teach something of how to "think like an editor" to its users, well... that's for another post, as it's a goal of one of the tools I'm building for my dissertation. (I've seen a few examples of editions trying out this possibility, such as the defunct playspace for rearranging Emily Dickinson's poems that used to be a part of the <a href="http://www.emilydickinson.org" ><em>Dickinson Electronic Archives</em></a>.)<em> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>4a. Seminar Experience:</strong> </em>One of Technoro's course requirements was for each participant to team-teach two class meetings. Students quickly expanded on fairly standard teaching approaches like preparing short lectures and bringing questions to class, to approaches that generated more new ideas such as thought and design experiments (e.g. <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/elit/" >imagining an e-lit remediations</a> of <em>Frankenstein</em>, or <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/team-2-caleb-williams-the-matrix/" >charting correspondences</a> between <em>Caleb Williams</em> and <em>The Matrix</em>); situating ourselves as masters of the material helped us become masters of it.</p>
<p><em><strong>4b. Edition Take-away:</strong> </em>An important moment in the life of a graduate student is shifting one's relationship with knowledge from student to master (from mostly reception to scholarly creation). Similarly, the moment the reader of an edition shifts from simply reading the text as he would a non-scholarly edition and begins to make use of the intricacies of the form is an important one; an even bigger step is when the reader is able to contribute back to the edition. Making sure our users can do this, whether through annotation, curation, or some other method (blog posts on how they've used the edition in their own work, scholarly or otherwise?)–and modeling how to do these things well–are smart pedagogical steps.<em> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>5a. Seminar Experience:</strong> </em>Always one of my favorite parts of a class: hearing what course ideas have caught fire in other students' minds and what they plan to make of those ideas. Technoro's projects were especially interesting because they often built on team skill-building from earlier in the course, where students either learned to do basic TEI encoding for manuscript pages of <em>Frankenstein</em> or to produce and understand topic models of Gothic texts. A good seminar encourages specialization of students' research beyond the main concerns of the class and supports communication of that specialized learning through final class projects that are shared with the entire class.</p>
<p><em><strong>5b. Edition Take-away:</strong></em> Every edition is a work of the editor's interpretation; every reading experience of an edition is an interpretation as well, and if you give the reader a path for communicating that interpretation she'll add to the collective pool of knowledge about a text. Similar to the previous take-away, let readers reflect their experience of the text by adding and/or curating annotations and related media–but also consider opening up your marked-up text so that users can create and submit different themes, functions, and interfaces with different interpretive resonances (more on difficulties, practical strategies, and existing work on editions as APIs in a future post).</p>

        Book Ghouls: Grangerizing as Book Hacking's Black Sheep

    <p><em>Update, 7/18/2013: My Archbooks Architecture of the Book Encyclopedia article on Grangerizing is now available: <a href="http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook//grangerizing.php" >http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook//grangerizing.php</a></em></p>
<p>Grangerizing is the expansion of a published book through the addition of illustrative images such as prints and etchings, as well as (to a lesser extent) textual material such as correspondence and playbills. Images are affixed on extra pages rebound into the codex (i.e. interleaves) or simply added on top of the existing text. This visual form of annotation is named after James Granger, an eighteenth-century collector, clergyman, and writer whose early use of the technique was rewritten as its origin; the technique was in vogue in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before the rise of cheap printed images and books.</p>
<p>Devotees of the popular hobby of Grangerizing argued that their reuse of visual material from other books was an “exquisite handicraft” that made use of texts that would otherwise have been junked (“Extending”). This reuse was another factor where Grangerizing and extra-illustration tended to differ; Grangerizers freely cannibalized other books to find the best images for their chosen text, while “extra-illustration” was a term usually applied to techniques that did not leave other books mutilated (Jackson 186). This cutting up of books caused a divide among book collectors as well as controversy with the general public; where the Grangerizers saw their work as curation and preservation of the best in image and text, others pointed to the increasing likelihood of encountering mutilated books with images (and often nearby text) snipped out.</p>
<p>For the book collectors whose goal was to preserve fine and historically interesting volumes as they were created, Grangerizing was a perversion of a long-celebrated activity–according to an 1892 critic, “‘breaking up a good book to illustrate a worse one” (“Extending”). The author of the 1809 treatise The Bibliomania speaks of “the mischief which this passion for collecting prints has occasioned” (Jackson 189). <strong>Bibliographic discussions from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are replete with colorful invective against the Grangerizers’ depredations, for which Holbrook Jackson's <em>The Anatomy of Bibliomania</em> is a rich and lighthearted source</strong> (especially the chapter "Grangeritis Diagnosed"). Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"as he that is bitten with a mad dog bites others, and all in the end become mad; either out of affection of novelty, vanity, or blind zeal, the giddy-headed will embrace the deep intricacies of Granger, and without farther examination approve them" (Ferriar as cited in Holbrook Jackson 576)</em></li>
<li><em>"Grangeritis… is a very general and violent symptom; the patient is a sort of literary Attila or Gengis Khan, who has spread terror and ruin around him; and he pursues his obscene passion with fiendish fascination: the moment Irving Brown came into possession of a book, it was put under the rack to extort its capacity for illustration. Of one hundred books extended by the insertion of prints which were not madefor them, ninety-nine are ruined; the hundredth book is no longer a book: it is a museum, or at best, a crazyquilt made of patches cut out of gowns of queens and scullions." (Burton, Locker-Lampson, Bulloch, "A lawyer of Troy, U.S.A.", Tredwell, and H. P. du Bois as cited by Holbrook Jackson 577)</em></li>
<li><em>"by Granger school'd</em> / <em>In Paper-books, superbly gilt and tool'd,</em> / <em>He pastes, from injur'd volumes snipt away,</em> / <em>His English Heads, in chronicled array" </em><em>(Ferriar as cited in Holbrook Jackson 578)</em></li>
<li><em>"May the spectre of Thomas Frognall Dibdin haunt the souls of these impious rascals, and torture them with never-ceasing visions of unobtainable and rare portraits, non-existent autographs, and elusive engravings" (Willaim P. Cutter as cited in Holbrook Jackson 580)</em></li>
<li><em>"Andrew Lang stoutly declares such a Book-Ghoul to be more hateful than the biblioklept, because he combines larceny with destruction: He is a collector of title-pages, frontispieces, illustrations, and look-plates. He prowls furtively among public and private libraries, inserting wetted threads, which slowly eat away the illustrations he covets; and he broods, like the obscene demon of Arabian superstitions, over the fragments of the mighty dead. He divides this variety into three classes: The antiquarian ghoul who steals title-pages and colophons. The aesthetic ghoul who cuts illuminated initials out of manuscripts; and the petty, trivial,and almost idiotic ghoul of our own days, who sponges the fly-leaves and boards of books for the purpose of cribbing the book-plates. This type is still regarded as a Book-Ghoul, even though his aim is grangerization. Uncompromising book-collectors branded James Gibbs, the grangerite-bookseller, as a book ghoul, a reptile who regards title-page and colophon as his natural prey" (Andrew Lang, Locker-Lampson as cited in Holbrook Jackson 573)</em></li>

<p>John Unsworth (1997) (Unsworth, J. (1997). Documenting the Reinvention of Text: The Importance of Failure. <em>The Journal of Electronic Publishing</em>, 3(2). Retrieved August 21, 2009, from http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;view=text;rgn=main;idno=3336451.0003.201.) argues that the benefits of hypertext (and other aspects of the digital humanities as well) need to be testable. To claim that digital texts offer benefits beyond those of print texts, digital humanists must be able to point to a theory that could potentially be disproven:</p>
<p  style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When a theorist of hypertext does make claims of a factual nature (such as the claim that hypertext is an improvement over the state of text in printed form)... (he) has obliged himself or herself to support those claims with empirical evidence and rational argument... <strong>If we do think that we are "reinventing the text"... then we must have a theory to guide that research, and it must be possible for that theory to be proven wrong by the evidence. In short, if failure isn't a possibility, neither is discovery.</strong> (Unsworth, emphasis added)</em></p>
<p>That digital texts offer a plethora of tools not found with traditional resources is not being debated. Whether or not these tools are actually in frequent use and benefiting their users has not received enough attention; digital humanists must assess not the quality of the digital text as an idealized resource, but its value when accessed by real scholars on a daily basis. Being so closely tied to a digital texts' development, scholar users of a digital text can quickly voice any issues with the project they are using; amateur users cannot similarly voice their needs. Thus, evaluating the value of real use by amateur digital text users is of great importance.</p>
<p>Amateur audiences may form the majority of users for many digital texts, and the digital humanities world is ready for a formal evaluation of this group's needs and perceptions. If the use value offered by digital texts in contrast to traditional resources seems obvious, then producing empirical evidence of these benefits should pose no problem—and yet, as demonstrated above, very little in the way of scientifically conducted testing of digital texts has taken place. (There are certainly good practical reasons for this--funding and time being the foremost.)</p>
<p>Digital humanists can remedy this lack of scientific proof of digital texts' value to users. First, <strong>digital humanists can test the structure of a digital text, examining the system that delivers resources to the user;</strong> this involves<strong> a usability approach</strong> that follows users in their functional interactions with a site's interface. Digital texts can potentially assist scholarly users with many tasks. The Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities (2006) (<em>Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities</em>(Report from the September 28-30, 2005 Summit). (2006). The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities: University of Virginia. Retrieved August 20, 2009, from http://www.iath.virginia.edu/dtsummit/SummitText.pdf.) identified four areas where attendees believed technology could aid humanities work: "interpretation, exploration of resources, collaboration, and visualization of time, space, & uncertainty" (p. 5). John Unsworth (2000) (Unsworth, J. (2000). Scholarly Primitives: What Methods Do Humanities Researchers Have in Common, and How Might Our Tools Reflect This? (Part of a symposium on “Humanities Computing: Formal Methods, Experimental Practice” sponsored by King's College, London, May 13, 2000). Retrieved August 20, 2009, from http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth//Kings.5-00/primitives.html.) provides a different list—“discovering, annotating, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and representing”—as basic human activities simple or “primitive” enough to be easily transferable to humanities computing. These individual features and tools of a digital text can be tested by straightforward usability studies.</p>
<p>Second, digital humanists can <strong>identify the value of a digital text's content</strong> by looking at the <strong>usefulness</strong> of the content to the scholar. Such a study would test the relevance of a digital text to its proposed audience, measuring the relatedness of the material to a project's users’ research (Saracevic, 2007a, p. 1918) (Saracevic, T. (2007a). Relevance: A Review of the Literature and a Framework for Thinking on the Notion in Information Science. Part II: Nature and Manifestations of Relevance. <em>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</em>, <em>58</em>(13), 1915-1933.). Saracevic (2007b) (Saracevic, T. (2007b). Relevance: A Review of the Literature and a Framework for Thinking on the Notion in Information Science. Part III: Behavior and Effects of Relevance. <em>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</em>, <em>58</em>(13), 2126-2144.) examined relevance studies that looked at user assessments of web pages, including comments on decision-making and measures of perceived usefulness and authority (p. 2127).</p>
<p>Third, digital humanists can <strong>identify the value of a digital text's content</strong> by looking at an audience's<strong> use</strong> of a digital text; such a study would look at user behavior, assessing what users are trying to do with a site and how they go about doing it. A measure of use is different from a measure of usefulness; where usefulness looks to the relevance of content to an audience, evaluating use requires looking at the efficacy of a digital text after its usefulness has been established or assumed (Park, 2000, p. 461) (Park, S. (2000). Usability, User Preferences, Effectiveness, and User Behaviors when Searching Individual and Integrated Full-Text Databases: Implications for Digital Libraries. <em>Journal of the American Society for Information Science,</em> 51(5): 456-468.).</p>
<p>My master’s thesis study focused on the last of these three value assessments, use. The least well-established benefit of digital texts is not the offloading of scholarly chores, but assistance to scholars in making new inferences and connections as suggested by their personal paths through material that is "both interactive and non-linear... a non-narrative experience for the user" (Katz, 2005, p. 113) (Katz, S. (2005). Why Technology Matters: The Humanities in the Twenty-First Century. <em>Interdisciplinary Science Reviews</em>, 30(2), 105-118.). Judging the worth of an entire digital text—that sum greater than the tools and resources it contains—is not as easy as quantifying the efficacy of individual features and can be accomplished with neither usability or relevance studies; instead, a digital text's worth should be judged by whether users are answering their research queries when using that resource, or coming to new, unforeseen realizations. Figuring out the worth of the whole digital text, rather than its component features, requires probing scholars' perceptions of their digital text use.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.08296723710373044"> </strong><em></em></p>
