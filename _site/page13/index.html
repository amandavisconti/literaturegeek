    <p>A quick review of contextualizing and digital resources for <em>Ulysses</em> editioning, plus some notes on how I'm imagining (and limiting my imagination of) the final "Infinite <em>Ulysses"</em> digital edition.</p>
<h2>Contextualized Joyce</h2>
<p>My project builds on previous Joycean contextualizing work: on the print side, Blamire's <em>New Bloomsday Book</em> and Gifford's <em>Ulysses An</em><em>notated</em>, and online, the <em><a href="http://www.jjon.org" >James Joyce Online Notes</a></em> and <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/cedp/tech%20colloquium%202001/groden%20files/hypermedia.html" >Michael Groden</a>'s notes and prototypes. Previous contextualizations (especially those on a higher, more macro-level of understanding the basics of <em>Ulysses</em> rather than specific allusions) carry an increased risk of authorial bias because of their individual authorship (e.g. the <em>Bloomsday Book</em> is very interested in charting Bloom's development as a Christ figure); while the sources I've named here are all excellent and useful pieces of scholarship, I'm very interested in seeing how a participatory edition apparatus moderates among a variety of higher-level contextual interpretations and whether we might thus prevent a canon of interpretation from calcifying around the text. <em>Ulysses</em> is also an interesting contextualization problem in that there are many sets of contextualizations floating around the web from both scholars and amateurs (in the old and new senses of the word); I’m interested in bringing diverse sets of interpretation together in one place and seeing how they overlap or contend with one another.</p>
<p>For digital projects that deal not only with annotation proper, but with how we can best display annotations for reading, check out Michael Groden's work (again), the <a href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~ehrlich/jjtm/demo/" >James Joyce Text Machine</a>, or my 2008/2009 (dated) prototype <a href="http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com" >UlyssesUlysses.com</a> (jump into reading <a href="http://ulyssesulysses.com/episode1.shtmlepisode1.shtml" >from here</a>; the navigation is a bit misleading).</p>
<h2>Scholarly Precedents</h2>
<p>Some key print precedents for this project are variorum and other editions that deal with a large quantity of variants, marginalia, or other annotation, such as the Shelley-Godwin manuscript notebooks and Hans Gabler’s synoptic <em>Ulysses</em>; these last two examples have convenient (though not-completely-realized) digital counterparts in Michael Groden’s <em>Ulysses in Hypermedia</em> prototype and the developing <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/" ><em>Shelley-Godwin Archive</em></a>. I will also build on my own research into handling multiple categories of annotation begun with the 2008-2009 <em>UlyssesUlysses</em> prototype (<a href="http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com" >UlyssesUlysses.com</a>), which is a dated site in terms of my technical and design abilities, but shows some of my first thinking about how we deal with the experience of accessing contextual annotations while reading.</p>
<h2>Caveats, questions, notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Ulysses</em> is an amazing text to test the possibilities of digital edition work, but for the quality of the site's main goals (and my desire to complete my dissertation in a reasonable amount of time), interesting and important edition features such as topic modeling the episodes, or giving more than a nod and an infrequent annotation to acknowledge the growth of the text into the form readers see in front of them (i.e. presenting a versioned text), aren't planned for this phase of the project. <em></em></li>
<li>I'll be releasing this project's code (Drupal modules, themes) on GitHub so that anyone can reuse or modify my work in their own digital edition.</li>
<li>I'm expecting the first phase of this digital edition to emphasize pedagogy as modeling knowledge: how do we pass through the text, how do we conceptually annotate what we're reading with some degree of "certainty"? I like to think that as we create annotations and visualizations and other features with the first-time reader in mind, we’re modeling and testing our scholarly knowledge: I’ll be able to do some analysis of data on how people read and annotate the text, explore the exploded <em>Ulysses</em>, examine debates over interpretation occurring on the site, and think about best practices for interface design for the public humanities. This digital edition will best flourish with input from all levels of <em>Ulysse</em>an experience, though; a public humanities discussion isn't at its richest if it's all public, no humanists. If you're familiar with Joyce, <em>Ulysses</em>, Modernism, and/or scholarly editing and have any suggestions for how this site could develop into a tool that’s useful for scholars visiting it from the front-end (and not just for my own behind-the-scenes theorizing), please do let me know (<a href="http://www.infiniteulysses.com/contact">contact page</a>). Or if you don’t have suggestions for this site because you don’t think you’d use it, tell me about how you like to access contextualizing information and what tools you wish existed for locating and working with it!</li>
<li>Can this site serve both first-time readers and scholars (people with different needs for the level of contextual annotation)? What about readers versus browsers versus searchers?</li>
<li>Questions like the last one are what makes framing this as an experiment useful--not only do I not know the answer to these questions of scope yet, I won't know how the site breaks or elicits unintentional (organic) usage until I test it with real users. In a future post, I'll discuss some of the ways I've anticipated real versus ideal use of the site, as well as some unanswered questions about the site's use.</li>

    <p>My "Infinite <em>Ulysses</em>" project falls more on the "digital editions" than the "digital editing" side of textual scholarship; these activities of coding, designing, and modeling how we interact with (read, teach, study) scholarly editions are usefully encompassed by Bethany Nowviskie's understanding of edition "<a href="http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/bpn2f/1866/interface.html" >interfacing".</a></p>
<p>Textual scholarship has always intertwined theory and practice, and over the last century, it’s become more and more common for both theory and practice to be accepted as critical activities. Arguments about which document (or eclectic patchwork of documents) best represents the ideal of a text, for example, were practically realized through editions of specific texts. As part of this theory through practice, design experiments are also a traditional part of textual scholarship, as with the typographic and spatial innovations of scholarly editor <a title="Recovering Teena Rochfort-Smith: Complex Edition Prototype, Female Victorian Editor" href="/2012/11/12/recovering-teena-rochfort-smith-complex-edition-prototype-female-victorian-editor" >Teena Rochfort-Smith’s 1883 <em>Four-Text 'Hamlet' in Parallel Columns</em></a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/rochfortsmithhamlet.jpg"></p>
<h2>How did we get here?</h2>
<p>The work of McKerrow and the earlier twentieth-century New Bibliographers brought a focus to the book as an artifact that could be objectively described and situated in a history of materials and printing practices, which led to theorists such as McKenzie and McGann’s attention to the social life of the book—its publication and reception—as part of an edition’s purview. This cataloging and description eventually led to the bibliographic and especially iconic (visual, illustrative) elements of the book being set on the same level of interpretive resonance as a book’s linguistic content by scholars such as McGann, Tinkle, and Bornstein. Concurrently, Randall McLeod argued that the developing economic and technological feasibility of print facsimile editions placed a more unavoidable responsibility on editors to link their critical decisions to visual proof. Out of the bias of my web design background, my interest is in seeing not only the visual design of the texts we study, but the visual design of their meta-texts (editions) as critical—asking how the interfaces that impart our digital editing work can be as critically intertwined with that editing as Blake’s text and images were interrelated.</p>
<h2>When is a digital object itself an argument?</h2>
<p>Mark Sample <a href="http://www.samplereality.com/2013/02/08/when-does-service-become-scholarship/" >has asked</a>, “When does anything—service, teaching, editing, mentoring, coding—become scholarship? My answer is simply this: a creative or intellectual act becomes scholarship when it is public and circulates in a community of peers that evaluates and builds upon it”. It isn’t whether something is written, or can be described linguistically, that determines whether critical thought went into it and scholarly utility comes out of it: it’s the appropriateness of the form to the argument, and the availability of that argument to discussion and evaluation in the scholarly community.</p>
<p>Editions—these works of scholarly building centered around a specific literary text, which build into materiality theories about the nature of texts and authorship—these editions we’re most familiar with are not the only way textual scholars can theorize through making. Alan Galey’s <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/index.html" ><em>Visualizing Variation</em></a> coding project is a strong example of non-edition critical building work from a textual scholar. The <em>Visualizing Variation</em> code sets, whether on their own or applied to specific texts, are (among other things) a scholarly response to the early modern experience of reading, when spellings varied wildly and a reader was accustomed to holding multiple possible meanings for badly printed or ambiguously spelled words in her mind at the same time. By experimenting with digital means of approximating this historical experience, Galey moves theorists from discussing the fact that this different experience of texts occurred to responding to an actual participation in that experience. (The image below is a still from an example of his "Animated Variants" code, which cycles contended words such as sallied/solid/sullied so that the reader isn't biased toward one word choice by its placement in the main text.)</p>
<p><img src="/assets/visualizingvariation.jpg"></p>
<p>Galey’s experiments with animating textual variants, layering scans of marginalia from different copies of the same book into a single space, and other approaches embodied as code libraries are themselves critical arguments: “Just as an edition of a book can be a means of reifying a theory about how books should be edited, so can the creation of an experimental digital prototype be understood as conveying an argument about designing interfaces” (Galey, Alan and Stan Ruecker. “How a Prototype Argues.” Literary and Linguistic Computing 25.4 (2010): 405-424.). These arguments made by digital prototypes and other code and design work, importantly, are most often arguments about meta-textual-questions such as how we read and research, and how interfaces aid and shape our readings and interpretations; such arguments are actually performed by the digital object itself, while more text-centric arguments—for example, what Galey discovered about how the vagaries of early modern reading would have influenced the reception of, for example, a Middleton play—can also be made, but often need to be drawn out from the tool and written up in some form, rather than just assumed as obvious from the tool itself.</p>
