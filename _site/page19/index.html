    <p><em>This is the first post in a <a title="DH Evaluation: A Three-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/3partdheval/" >four-part series</a> on user testing for DH projects.</em></p>
<p>Let’s start extremely practical: <strong>what we can do in a single day towards user testing our own small-scale DH tools and projects?</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Photo of affinity diagram on wall made of post-it notes" src="/assets/affinitywall-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225">To know the affinity diagram is to fear it! Although it's a useful assessment tool, I'll be recommending some kinder ways of evaluating how your DH project treats its audience. (Photo by author's contextual inquiry team, Fall 2009)</p>
<h2>1. Analytics! Analytics! Analytics! (Know Thy Audience)</h2>
<p>Even if you have no funding and only an hour of free time, I cannot see any reason for not installing <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics" >Google Analytics</a> on your DH project website (or your blog or portfolio, for that matter). Google Analytics tracks visitors to your site and gives you information like your site’s busiest days of the week, how long visitors are spending on any given page, whether your readers are using mobile devices to access your site, and where in the world your visitors are from. All this is not only fascinating and flattering (<em>neat! people are looking at your work!</em>), but it helps you build a better website and project by giving you some free information on who’s interested in what pages of your site, and what kind of technological needs they have for accessing your content.</p>
<p>Drop me a comment if you'd enjoy a post on setting up and generating custom reports with Google Analytics to find out who’s using your DH website and how. It’s pretty easy to set up, though (but generating customized reports is a bit tricky): on any site, you can insert some lines of code the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics" >Google Analytics</a> site will give you to start tracking; if you’re running Wordpress (WP), this is even easier: behold, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/">Google Analytics plugin</a>! (On WP, you’ve probably also got the nifty Jetpack statistics running, which provide less powerful but still useful analyses of your site users than Google Analytics.)</p>
<h2>2. What Do You Want to Study About Your Users?</h2>
<p>If your time and money is limited, it might help to separate out <strong>what you most care about studying about your audience</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Usability:</strong> Can your site <em>be used</em> as you intend? Is it difficult to navigate or to understand how the content is presented? To assess usability, you might give a set of readers the same task to achieve through your site (e.g. “Tell me about how and why James Joyce’s drafts look different at different stages of writing”) and observe the time and steps each reader takes to provide you with an answer.</li>
<li><strong>Good Usability or Bad Usability</strong>?: In a study headed by Jan Spyridakis*, researchers found that ease of retention of visually-accessed knowledge often meant... bad usability! Design that interrupts narrative flow, exercises working memory, and forces readers to establish context all served to better retention of information. When trying to apply understandings of the reading brain to DH project design, we really need to understand more about humanities-specific reading (i.e. long texts and research reading patterns). As we design for research and learning, we need to ask ourselves whether we are aiming at use or usability--do we want the user to go our way or their way? Are there ways to make these more compatible ends?</li>
<li><strong>Use:</strong> <em>How</em> are people using your site--as intended, or for other ends? Using a tool like Google Analytics is a start toward knowing who’s using your stuff, but to go beyond demographics and what pages are getting visited, you’ll need to think about a tactic like soliciting use stories from site visitors.</li>
<li><strong>Usefulness:</strong> If your site can be used as intended (usability), is it <em>actually helping</em> the people you’re looking to serve? A simple, quick embedded survey (e.g. from <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com" >SurveyMonkey</a>, which I think gives a free upgraded version to graduate students--at least it did in 2009) can let your visitors tell you whether they found what they were looking for, had any issues with your navigation or comprehension, or would like to see something new on your site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Build On Existing Metrics (Standards of Measurement)</h2>
<p>Depending on what you’re studying, you don’t necessarily need to build a metric from scratch--in fact, in some cases it’s best to adapt previous work. Here’s a section from my master’s thesis on basing my metrics on other researchers’ work, with the plainspeak take-aways below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The instrument (metric I used to conduct research) is a combination of pieces of <strong>two pre-existing instruments derived for research on similar topics</strong>. A study by Koohang (2004)* assessed the usability of e-learning courseware with a focus on user's perceptions of the courseware's usability, <strong>much as the current</strong> study assesses learner's perceptions of digital text features and use; <strong>both Koohang's work and this study also looked at</strong> the effect of technology experience on user experience and educational success. A study by Harley et al. (2006)* assessed digital resource use in the undergraduate humanities and social sciences; <strong>as with the current study</strong>, Harley's emphasized the need for user studies to empirically understand the desires of users of digital learning tools.</p>
<p>The Likert item questions (spectrum of answers indicated by radio buttons) drew from both of the instruments used in these previous studies, as <strong>they provided a tested example of the assessment of a digital resource's user experience</strong>. The analysis of quantitative data also drew from Koohang's (2004) study; <strong>where</strong> Koohang compared years of Internet experience with assessments of e-learning courseware usability using ANOVAs, this study compared years of Internet experience and degree of experience with digital texts with the results of ten scaled-response questions assessing digital text use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote my master’s thesis shortly after finding out that what I was doing was digital humanities, so I’m certain my master's thesis discussion of the lack of DH user studies misses out at least good DH evaluation work that had been done before 2009, though not for lack of searching--such work is still difficult to locate (thus, the DH Now <a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/2012/10/solicitating-writing-on-assessment-and-evaluation-of-dh-work/">solicitation for writing on these topics</a>). What isn’t as difficult is finding evaluation work from other domains such as education and computer science that can be useful in assessing at least your website-based work (e.g. the Koohang study mentioned above, which studies perceptions of usability instead of usability). I've bolded all the parallels I drew between their studies and mine; don't forget to be clear in any public write-up you create from your testing justifying how the metrics you created/adpated were the right ones (social science papers provide some good tips on how such a write-up differs from a traditional humanities paper).</p>
<p>If you don’t have a lot of time or experience with user testing, finding an existing metric that applies to your questions about audience means you can spend less time worrying whether your results will say what you think they say, and more time analyzing those results when you get them. Not only is it good to not reinvent the wheel, adapting another researchers’ metric (remember to cite!) lets you read about how that metric was applied and what the results and issues with the tool were.</p>
<p><em><strong>I hope these quick ideas were helpful! <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/01/amateurinthearchive/" >Tomorrow</a>, I'll be writing about a specific user audience that interests me: "amateur" users, aka citizen scholars or interested audience members from outside the academy/alt-ac world.</strong></em></p>

        Five Tips for Getting Started on a Digital Humanities Dissertation

    <p>As you might have noticed from this blog and my tweets, I'm in the opening act of what promises to be an exciting and non-traditional doctoral literature dissertation. I'll be blogging the actual content of the dissertation in the months to come, but for now I'd like to share some of the things that have helped me mediate between my digital and humanist goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the beginning of writing the prospectus, identify all roles that have advisory and/or control relationships to the final form of your dissertation, and <strong>ask them to acknowledge in writing the conditions under which they will accept the dissertation format you propose</strong>. I talked with our library’s digital repository (which ingests dissertations), the graduate school (which has final say in granting my degree), my graduate department (to help them understand how my dissertation format choice is good both for me and for the department), and my dissertation committee (of course!).</li>
<li><strong>Generate a monthly schedule for completing both the digital work (coding, metadata, whatever) and writing for your project.</strong> <strong>Have options in place</strong> in case a) coding takes longer than planned and/or b) you need to make changes from the code you originally planned to create (e.g. it’s too hard to do or someone else does it first).</li>
<li>With all the members of your dissertation committee, <strong>hold a meeting that is focused on practical aspects of your dissertation’s running and marketing</strong> (both to non-DH members of your department and the larger community). You’ll likely need to do some extra work over a traditional dissertation’s requirements to justify the format of your dissertation and how it fits into your degree program (in my case, literature); <strong>this is actually a really helpful, mindful exercise that I think all students should do whether or not they’re producing digital work</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Plan towards eventual publication of your work</strong>, considering both traditional venues and more recent projects that can handle both writing and new media projects. If you’ll be blogging as part of the process, consider how this writing can become part of the finished project, whether it can be republished, and the risks and rewards of early publication. Think about how the nature of what you can publish out of your dissertation will affect your job prospects (e.g. students seeking tenure-track teaching positions need to think carefully if they’re not creating something very book-like).</li>
<li><strong>Be clear on your career goals and what skills you’d like to improve over the coming years of your dissertation</strong>, and <strong>identify who will be supporting the more technological aspects of your project</strong>. How can you use your dissertation to develop and demonstrate these skills? Think not just about improving existing skills or honing one ability, but about diversifying your skills.</li>
</ol>

    <p><em>Cross-posted from a long comment to a <a href="http://www.hastac.org/blogs/agmullen/2012/10/05/digital-humanities-impostor-syndrome" >HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory)</a> post by Abby Mullen.</em></p>
<div>
<p>Over on HASTAC, Abby Mullen writes about "DH imposter syndrome" for people new to DH. My reply:</p>
<p>A great thing about DH is that even for people who've been involved for several years (e.g. me) or many years (as with many of my co-workers at MITH and my graduate advisors), there will always be large areas of DH work where each of us is ignorant. Sure, there are commonplaces and vocabulary that everyone picks up over time, as well as a sense of some of the more-trodden discussions (e.g. the community attitude toward big data, small data, deep data; toward defining what is DH and who is a DHer; and towards games and education, online learning, and the scholarly status of digital creations). But if you go to a <a href="http://www.thatcamp.org" >THATCamp</a> (which I heartily recommend if you haven't), you'll quickly notice that</p>
<ul>
<li>the person with the most to say in one session is a complete n00b in a later session (people go to THATCamps to learn stuff they don't know!),</li>
<li>that almost everyone there is excited to explain their work to anyone who will listen--and that explaining it to someone with no background in their area means that they'll get to hear new types of feedback, and</li>
<li>that, much less than in the traditional humanities (though of course things aren't perfectly utopianic here either), you don't need to wait to ascend the hierarchy to get your projects seen, to talk in or lead a session (or even <a href="http://www.thatcampgames.org" >run your own THATCamp</a> on the THATCamp topic of your dreams!), or to learn skills and tools that allow you to do better work without the benefits of a full-time position, tenure, or much/any funding (e.g. Omeka, Zotero, Wordpress--all tools THATCampers teach at most Bootcamps that are free or require cheap hosting fees)</li>
</ul>
<p>DH, as I and many see it, has a strong pedagogical focus; part of everyone's work in their particular niche of DH (whether that's mapping, topic modeling, something else) is not only to do awesome things, but to share it with the DH community in a way that non-specialists can understand. There's also a great movement in DH toward a more public humanities aimed at people outside the academy who are passionantly curious about history, narrative, etc. (e.g. the <a href="http://humanistica.ualberta.ca">4humanities project</a> and work that seeks to use the wisdom of the crowd for interpretive rather than mechanical tasks, such as the Scholars' Lab's <a href="http://prism.scholarslab.org/" >Prism,</a> comments in the LOC historical photo Flickr stream, and the <a href="http://menus.nypl.org">NYPL menus project</a>).</p>
<p>I don't mean to say that you (or anyone) won't feel like an imposter for a while upon first getting involved in DH (or, as I've pointed out, that you won't continue to feel like an imposter recurrently over the years as DH folds in new tools and approaches and disciplines). What I do mean to say is (from the viewpoint of a fellow grad student) that feeling like an imposter in DH is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>actually more substantiated in DH than in the traditional humanities, and <em>that's a good thing</em></strong>; I think it's less scary to feel like you don't know enough when you actually don't and <em>can't</em> possibly be an expert on everything that's going on. <a href="http://tedunderwood.com/2012/09/22/how-everyone-gets-to-claim-they-do-dh/">As Ted Underwood recently pointed out</a>, DH is less fakable than the traditional humanities because of the skill-learning and interdisicplinarity involved, but I take that to mean it frees everyone up to admit ignorance and n00bishness without losing professional face--and to get the help they desire.</li>
<li><strong>not something that you should let make you feel like "less DH" than anyone else</strong>; everyone was a n00b with every DH skill at one point, the proliferation of new tools and approaches means that everyone is going to be a n00b at something again and again, and the DH community is pretty good (and getting better) at offering opportunities online and off for learning about the stuff you want to know but don't yet understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the people smart Tweeps you already know are following, and don't be afraid to tweet at them when you don't follow something. CHNM's Tom Scheinfeldt has <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/36" >a great blog post/<em>Debates in DH</em> chapter</a> (the latter is another great resource for diving into DH, by the way: both chapters and really finely crafted blog posts covering a lot of the field's preoccupations) discussing how DH is a peculiarly "nice" field, in large part because of our emphasis on skills and methodology (so there's another benefit to those aspects of DH that make it a little harder to pick up). If someone's doing DH and they're not willing to at least say "try going and reading this book/post/project site", they're going to be a bit anomalous. Also, don't be shy about tweeting a link when you have a new blog post, or to mention you Twitter handle frequently (I looked up your handle after reading this post, but I'm usually more lazy about that!).</p>
<p>Also, it's totally okay to not care about some aspects of the DH field; choose the things that help you do better work in areas you care about. Even if you don't know how your non-DH work relates to what people are doing digitally yet, DH probably relates way more than you can currently imagine. It did for me: I left college wanting to somehow mash up my love of complex books and making websites, then found out about online editions, topic modeling, text visualization, literary games... and a lot of other amazing things that people with similar interests were doing with digital tools. Finding out that other people were doing this stuff was an eye-opener! You know what you care about, so enlist others to help you find the DH work that might intrigue you or help you out, either through HASTAC posts, tweeting, or the <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/">DH Q&A site</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and for anyone reading this who's intrigued by DH but hasn't gone to a THATCamp: you should. Really. Check out <a href="http://www.thatcamp.org">the main page</a> and look for one near you (some can also offer limited travel assistance to a few attendees), or tweet @thatcamp if you need help or reassurance that you'll fit in :) And yes, THATCamps are full of people just dipping their toes (or cannon-balling) into the DH waters, so it will be pretty impossible for you to feel like you don't fit in at one.</p>
