    <p>(Reposted from <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/5">my blog</a> over on <a href="http://www.THINKtransmedia.org">THINKtransmedia.org</a>--check out the site for a community of transmedia and ARG designers and scholars. Read more about our research study, <a href="http://www.arcanegalleryofgadgetry.org/research/">Alternate Reality Games in the Service of Education and Design</a>, over at the National Science Foundation.)</p>
<p><img alt="Front page of http://www.THINKTransmedia.org" src="/assets/thinktm-300x251.jpg" width="300" height="251"></p>
<p>I'm a graduate research assistant working with THINKtransmedia.org community members <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/4">Derek Hansen</a> (PI), <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/5">Kari Kraus</a> (PI), and <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/6">Elisabeth Bonsignore</a> on an NSF-funded study exploring the design and use of ARGs in educational contexts. The purpose of this research is to better understand how transmedia storytelling experiences can be used as novel educational activities. We're also trying to improve our understanding of how experts and novices create transmedia experiences and experience them, with a special emphasis on the use of mobile devices.<br>
<br>
Our study falls roughly into three parts:<br>
<strong>1. Expert Interviews</strong><br>
Over the past year, we've been interviewing experts in the area of ARG design and development, transmedia studies, and games and learning. Our previous interviewees include <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/9">Margeaux Johnson</a>, a recent MLS grad from UMD who is now a science/reference librarian at the University of Florida; she spoke with us about her experiences designing an information literacy mission/quest as part of a larger university ARG ("Humans vs. Zombies"). We have also interviewed <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/10">Georgina Goodlander</a>, Interpretive Programs Manager Smithsonian at the American Art Museum and one of the developers behind their very recent ARG "Pheon". Margeaux and Georgina are also THINKtransmedia.org community members, so feel free to contact them with questions about their transmedia work.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> as of 01/2011, we've also interviewed <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=content/interview-sean-stewart">Sean Stewart</a> (ARG-writer extraordinaire <em>of The Beast</em>, <em>ilovebees</em>, <em>Last Call Poker</em>, and the <em>Cathy's Book</em> series, to name a few), <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/146">Drew Davidson</a> (director of the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University), <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/145">Heather Owings</a> (librarian and developer of several ARGs for and with teens), <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/144">James Gee</a> (games and education theorist and author of <em>What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy</em> and <em>Good Video Games + Good Learning</em>), <em>World without Oil</em> designer <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/142">Ken Eklund</a>, and <a href="http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/141">John Maccabee</a> (novelist; designer of ARGs such as the Smithsonian's "Ghosts of a Chance"; and CEO at CityMystery, which specializes in building educational ARGs).</p>
<p><strong>2. Novice Designers</strong><br>
We've created a pool of ARG game-design novices from one of Professor Hansen's graduate iSchool classes as well as members of the research team. This team of "novice designers" will create a transmedia lesson plan that includes a mini-puzzle, the best of which will be used in an actual ARG. This group will both help us populate are ARG and study how first-time game designers confront design tasks; we'll be documenting their work through interviews and design diary activities throughout the design process.</p>
<p><strong>3. ARG Players</strong><br>
We're developing an ARG (with the help of the novice design group) to run during spring 2011. This part of the study will look at the place of ARGs within education--by working with both middle-schoolers and undergrads, we hope to build on our understanding of how ARGs communicate and reinforce learning, especially the learning of information literacies such as information-finding and collaboration.</p>

<p>The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) just released the web presence for its Deena Larsen Collection of early electronic literature:</p>
<p><a href="http://mith.umd.edu/larsen">http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/</a></p>
<p>I created this website as part of the IMLS-funded Digital Humanities Model Internship; besides touting the awesomeness of the collection (a shower curtain/analog website! early electronic literature built in Hypercard! Mac Classic upon Mac Classic!), I'd like to mention the software I used to build the site. <a href="http://www.omeka.org">Omeka</a> (created by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason, which also created the wonderful bibliographic tool Zotero...) is a CMS crafted specifically for use with any kind of collection, from archives and museums to course materials to cultural memory sites. Omeka offers a web interface for the non-tech-savvy, but is also infinitely customizable for those who know PHP. Check out their site if you're interested in building any kind of online artifact repository.<br>

<p>Here's MITH's official release on the website:</p>
<p><em>The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) is very pleased to announce the release of a new Web site showcasing the Deena Larsen Collection we house and maintain:</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.mith.umd.edu/larsen" >http://www.mith.umd.edu/larsen</a></em></p>
<p><em>Deena Larsen, whose best-known works include the hypertexts Marble Springs and Samplers (both published by Eastgate Systems), has been active in the creative electronic writing community nearly since its inception in the early 1980s. She has also been a collector and de facto archivist for that community, amassing what she has described as electronic literature's "Great Library of Alexandria." In May 2007 she gave MITH the extraordinary gift of her personal collection of early-era computers, software, and digital files.</em></p>
<p><em>The collection includes not only Deena's own extensive literary output, but original and sometimes unpublished material by nearly every author in her circle, effectively making it a cross-section of electronic writing during its key formative years (roughly 1985-1995). The hardware in the collection consists of five Mac Classics, two Mac SEs, and a Mac Plus, and associated accessories; the physical media includes some 800 diskettes, as well as nearly 100 CD-ROMs and Zip disks. The collection also contains manuscripts, newspaper clippings, books, comics, manuals, notebooks, syllabi, catalogs, brochures, posters, conference proceedings, and ephemera. According to Matthew Kirschenbaum, Associate Director of MITH and Associate Professor of English at Maryland, "The arrival of Deenas collection at MITH furnishes us with invaluable source material which will further our in-house research in digital curation and preservation, as well as function as a unique resource for the growing number of researchers interested in early hypertext and electronic literature."</em></p>
<p><em>The site, built with Omeka, was designed by Amanda Visconti of the University of Michigan under the auspicices of the IMLS-funded Digital Humanities Model Internship program, which places iSchool students in working digital humanities centers. Kari Kraus, director of the program and Assistant Professor in Maryland's iSchool and English department, comments: "Amanda's work is a great example of the kind of collaboration and mutual exchange we're working to promote."</em></p>
