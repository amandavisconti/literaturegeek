<h2>"What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up? Public Humanities, Participatory Design, and Infinite Ulysses"</h2>
<p><em>(transcript of talk delivered at <a title="Upcoming Talk @Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities 2014" href="/2014/03/26/upcomingnebraskatalk/" >Nebraska DH Forum 2014</a>)</em></p>
<p><img src="/assets/newlogo2.jpg" alt="Draft of logo for Infinite Ulysses site" width="409" height="175"></p><p>Draft of logo for Infinite Ulysses site</p>
<p>What if we build a digital edition and everyone (millions of scholars, first-time readers, book clubs, teachers and their students) shows up and annotates the text with their infinite interpretations, questions, and contextualizations? The “Infinite <em>Ulysses</em>” project pursues this speculative experiment, and today I'm going to talk about how this unlikely hypothetical is helping me study and improve DH interface usability.</p>
<p>Textual scholar Morris Eaves conceives of editions not just as vessels for textual content, but as “problem-solving mechanisms”; and I'm using this speculative edition experiment to both</p>
<ul>
<li>produce something practically useful, designing and coding an actual digital edition of James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> with a number of experimental interface features, and then</li>
<li>conducting use and usability testing with real readers and researchers to focus on three interrelated lines of questioning:</li>
</ul>
<p><b>1. First, a question about how such an experiment can benefit the humanities:</b> How can we design digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and the lay person in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning?</p>
<p><b>2. Second, a question about how we make such a thing as my speculative idea work:</b> How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (things like upvoting & tagging) to create reading and research experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of user-generated contextual annotation quantity but also quality?</p>
<p><b>3. And third, a question about how this interface work affects the texts at its core: </b>What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like <em>Ulysses</em>—when a participatory digital edition places them under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?</p>
<h2>Some Quick Definitions</h2>
<p>I'll be discussing how scholarly digital edition development helps us look at these three questions, and I'll also address how the overall Infinite <em>Ulysses</em> project functions as an unusually shaped humanities dissertation. Before I go any further, though, I want to define some words I'll be using a lot:</p>
<p>The "<b>digital editions</b>" I'm talking about are literary or other texts that have been prepared for online reading and research by a scholarly editor according to a carefully constructed interpretation and methodology. These are digital editions like those on the <em>Whitman</em> or <em>Shelley-Godwin Archives</em>, rather than the digitized/scanned and non-interpreted texts you find on Google Books.</p>
<p>I'll also be talking about "<b>annotations</b>" a lot. When a reader "annotates" my digital edition, they're highlighting a word, phrase, or other section of the literary text, then typing in a comment on that highlighting. This annotation then appears in the margin of the text depending on some other factors.</p>
<p>Finally, I'll be talking about "<b>speculative design</b>", a design approach that imagines future challenges and opportunities, and builds design solutions both imbued with theoretical innovation and the possibility of future utility. It's a way of using hypotheticals to make connections you might not otherwise make. My designing a digital edition that could handle a hypothetical public wildly interested in annotating a complex text is a speculative experiment that's helping me think about customizing annotations to individual researchers, and about how heavy annotation changes an unwieldy text like Ulysses.</p>
<h2>Participatory, Public</h2>
<p>Scholarly editor Gary Taylor has asked : “How can you love a work, if you don’t know it? How can you know it, if you can’t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” Scholarly editors are an integral part of the continuum that keeps the stories of the past available to and understood by the present—but just as important in Taylor’s formulation is the you, that public of not just scholars, but also readers in and beyond the academy whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant.</p>
<p>Lindsey Thomas notes that "making something freely available online does not necessarily guarantee that thing is public, or that it will be used as a public resource"*. I'm interested in building tools and digital editions that help both textual scholars and the lay person participate in our love for the nuances of a text; and I'm especially interested in how we can use interface design to encourage not just consumption of, but participation in the humanities.</p>
<p>One way of thinking about participatory platforms is as a classroom. What's the connection between teaching and editions?</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">"[Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman] prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, ‘Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.’ ...Feynman said, ‘I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.’ </span><span class="s2"><b>But he came back a few days later to say, ‘I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don’t really understand it.‘</b></span><span class="s1">" </span><em>— David L. Goodstein, in Feynman’s Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun </em></p>
<p>I like how this Feynman quotation expresses that teaching is knowing, that we learn something more intimately when compelled to make our knowledge declarative for others, and if we're not able to teach a thing, then we might not know it as well as we thought. When I think about designing welcoming digital editions and other digital humanities sites, I often think about how we can make them more like a really good graduate seminar experience, where scaffolded discussion helps you think and discuss better.</p>
<p>The flip side to the metaphor of a classroom as a participatory space is that many digital editions are kind of participatory once removed. By aiming their content at teachers with things like teaching guides and sample assignments, they do a great job at humanities outreach, but the learning and discussion usually happens off the actual digital project site, and thus doesn't feed into the experience of other users.</p>
<h2>Participatory Design</h2>
<p>I've just discussed a more loose way of thinking about "participatory" design. There's also a more rigorous definition for participatory design that comes from the field of human-computer interaction (or HCI). HCI, a field focused on interfaces between user and computer (including interfaces of reading and research), provides this useful approach to a humanities that simultaneously benefits the public and scholars. Participatory design is an approach not just centered on the scholar or just on the public, but finessing the “third space” of discussion and shared learning that exists when the two groups come into conversation; Michael Muller has found that results can include “challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal dialogues across and through differences"*.</p>
<p>Some sites and projects are intended "primarily with scholars in mind", and these are necessary and important contributions to the academy and human knowledge. On the other hand, I feel like non-designers are too quick to repeat the cliched "you can't design for multiple audiences", instead of thinking "<b>how do I design for this space where we learn together?</b>" For example, in a formal usability study of public use of several key digital archives, I found that it was often very simple interface changes users desired in order to be able to understand and use a DH site. When we bring the public into our scholarly conversations, everyone can benefit, and it's important to remember that designing for interactive participation and pedagogy is itself a scholarly activity that also benefits the public.</p>
<h2>Infinite Ulysses: What's It Going to Look Like?</h2>
<p>Let's turn to the Infinite <em>Ulysses</em> digital edition and how I'm designing it to be participatory. Here's the simple version of what my edition will let scholars and readers do: read the text online on their laptop, iPad, or tablet; when they run into something in their reading, whether that's a question, or an interpretation or context they wish to share, or an answer for a question left by another reader, they'll be able to highlight that piece of the text and add that as an annotation, which will then show up to the side of the text. Readers can also add tags to these annotations and up- or down-vote them, as well as have the option to fill out site profiles with fields for research interests, whether you've read the text before, and other details to aid in site customization.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3485" src="/assets/IUsimplecycle.jpg" alt="The site lets readers add notes and otherwise discuss the text, then uses those notes to make a more customized experience for each reader." width="462" height="508">The site lets readers add notes and otherwise discuss the text, then uses those notes to make a more customized experience for each reader.</p>
<p>I'm not going to demo the site because I've been focusing on coding the interface behavior and not on the final theming design yet. The final site won't look like this, but it's a general sense of the layout:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/InfiniteUlyssesWebDesign1-300x225.jpg" alt="Old wireframe capturing general layout of site (but not current design work)." width="300" height="225">Old wireframe capturing general layout of site (but not current design work).</p>
<ul>
<li>a central column of reading text</li>
<li>a drawer on the right for creating and reading annotations</li>
<li>a drawer on the left for customizing your view of the text</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Potential Issues with which I'll Be Dealing!</h2>
<p>This project combines its speculative design approach with the scholarly primitive of curation (dealing with information abundance and quality and bias), imagining scholarly digital editions as popular sites of interpretation and conversation around a text. Of course, with our hypothetical millions of users and annotations, we can't display all of them next to the text, and you'd quickly see the entire text covered in a single block of yellow highlighting if we left everything highlighted that ever got annotated. By drawing from examples of how people actually interact with text on the internet, such as on the social community Reddit and the Q&A StackExchange sites, I’m creating a digital edition interface that allows site visitors to create and interact with a potentially high number of annotations and interpretations of the text.</p>
<p>The big questions I'm trying to answer with this interface design are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If everyone’s submitting annotations to a digital edition, how can we automate the massive task of curation and moderation so that it occurs in a timely and unbiased manner?</li>
<li>And once we’ve separated the wheat of critical yet diverse annotations from the chaff of repetitions, spam, and under-substantiated suggestions, how do we make the still-plentiful remaining material accessible to the users it would best serve?</li>
<li>That is, how do we separate the signal from the noise when the “signal” of pertinent contextual annotations means different things for different reader needs?</li>
</ul>
<p>My project is testing out to what degree using tags, upvoting, and profile information can help customize the reading experience for each reader. The hypothetical here is that we're able to filter the annotations to match the level of help a person needs, or their research interests; and, when there are still too many annotations available for a given word or phrase, at least cycle randomly through better subsets of annotations than the entire available pool. I've been coding to follow what seems to work best for existing successful online communities, including by visiting these communities' spaces for meta-analysis such as the subreddit "theory of reddit", but we won't know how well this works with a digital edition until I begin my usability testing this fall.</p>
<h2>Site Features</h2>
<p>I won't read through all the examples of functions I've been coding for (<a title="Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition" href="/2013/06/25/iufeatures/" >you can read a full list in this post</a>), but here are a few examples of things you should be able to do with the edition:</p>
<ol>
<li>filter the annotations to only show those on particular areas of interest (e.g. annotations that translate foreign words, or annotations aimed at first-time readers)</li>
<li>filter out annotations the reader doesn’t want to see (e.g. spoilers about something that only becomes clear later in the book)</li>
<li>easily create a curated “edition” of <em>Ulysses</em> showing only annotations aimed at a specific topic (e.g. an edition meant for use by a class focusing on the place of books, letters, newspapers, and other written material in the Modernist novel), and/or only see annotations added by specific users, such as members of a class or book club</li>
</ol>
<p>So, will we get enough annotations, tagging, and voting to make the site work? Even if the site doesn't have many more annotations and tags than the base set provided by me and several contributing scholars, it'll still be a useful public site. Some years back, I built a prototype non-participatory digital edition of <em>Ulysses</em> that was much simpler, but dealt with similar questions of interface design for ease of <em>Ulysses</em> first-time reading; unfortunately it's now very technically dated and has a frightening color palette; I still hear from random people around the world that they've read its two chapters of <em>Ulysses</em> and want more, though, so I do think there is already a desire for a certain way of presenting <em>Ulysses</em> online with annotation. I'm really hoping to be able to support a resource that is not only read, though, but also participated in, so that we can hear many more voices in our discussion of <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<h2>Will Readers Tag?</h2>
<p>The LibraryThing blog has <a href="http://goo.gl/FGJRrC" >a great article on how people tag things for themselves</a>, not just because a site offers it, for personal reasons like aiding in memory and socializing. LibraryThing has found success with users tagging books, while Amazon's book tagging feature has failed (I didn't even know you could tag books!). I choose <em>Ulysses</em> for my test text in part because it occupies a special position: difficult enough that people welcome help in reading it, yet still very much in the popular consciousness as something that can and should be read (as opposed to, say, Finnegans Wake). People tweet about trying to read <em>Ulysses</em> all the time, hold reunions with book clubs with whom they read the text in the past, and celebrate the <em>Ulysses</em> holiday of Bloomsday every June. There's an audience out there to support with such a site, and I'm expecting that people will use the site's features in a way that benefits themselves but also others, whether they choose to annotate and tag and vote to interact with people they know offline like book clubs, or want to create a customized annotated edition for teaching or research use, or want to help track clues throughout the book, or otherwise serve the same purpose as sticky notes and penciled marginalia in print books.</p>
<h2>Digital Humanities Use and Usability</h2>
<p>I'll be conducting both use and usability studies to understand and build from user feedback. Usability is concerned with whether the site lets users simply and intuitively do what the site is meant to do—that is, read <em>Ulysses</em> and participate in a discussion around it. To study this, I can for example see how much time or how many clicks it takes a user to get to the text and add a question or other annotation. Use is the equally interesting study of how people actually use the site; do they want to tag annotations? do they want to do unexpected things like literary role-playing using the annotations? To some extent, I've tried to design for expected "non-official" uses, such as realizing that people would use the annotation feature to ask questions and supporting it both by allowing filtering for questions and answers, and creating a link to a feed of all unanswered questions.</p>
<h2>Literary Texts under Participation</h2>
<p>The third question this project is helping me explore is about <em>Ulysses</em> itself. What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic—under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?</p>
<p>My project builds on previous Joycean contextualizing work: such as Blamire’s Bloomsday Book and Gifford’s <em>Ulysses</em> Annotated. Previous contextualizations (especially those on a higher, more macro-level of understanding the basics of <em>Ulysses</em> rather than specific allusions) carry an increased risk of authorial bias because of their individual authorship (e.g. the Bloomsday Book is very interested in charting Bloom’s development as a Christ figure); while the sources I’ve named are all excellent and useful pieces of scholarship that have improved my enjoyment of the novel, I’m very interested in seeing how a participatory edition might moderate among a variety of higher-level contextual interpretations and whether we might thus prevent a canon of interpretation from calcifying around the text, or at least multiple popular key streams of thinking around the text within the same digital space. <em>Ulysses</em> is also an interesting contextualization problem in that there are many sets of contextualizations floating around the web from both scholars and amateurs (in the old and new senses of the word); I’m interested in bringing diverse sets of interpretation together in one place and seeing how they overlap or contend with one another.</p>
<p>Some key print precedents for this project are variorum and other editions that deal with a large quantity of variants, marginalia, or other annotation, such as the Shelley-Godwin manuscript notebooks and Hans Gabler’s synoptic <em>Ulysses</em> edition; these last two examples have convenient digital counterparts in Michael Groden’s never-finished <em>Ulysses</em> in Hypermedia prototype, and the developing Shelley-Godwin Archive.</p>
<h2>Ulysses + Hyperannotation = ???</h2>
<p>While there isn’t a complete critical digital edition of <em>Ulysses</em> yet published, that hasn’t kept Joycean scholars from anticipating issues that might arise with the eventual migration to digital space. Where the limitations of print space have in the past kept annotations of the text in check, what will happen when a digital platform allows the addition and navigation of infinite annotations? Can we migrate complex print hypertexts such as <em>Ulysses</em> to a digital space with socially multiplied annotations without, as Mark Marino wonders, “diminish[ing] the force of the book”? Marino asks, "Assuming it were possible, would the creation of a system that automatically makes available all the allusions, unravels all the riddles, and translates foreign languages normalize Joyce’s text?"</p>
<p>Derek Attridge similarly sees a risk in <em>Ulysses</em>' hypertextualization and hyperannotation, saying "[<em>Ulysses</em>'] cultural supremacy, and the scholarly efforts which reflect and promote that supremacy, have turned it into a text that confirms us in our satisfied certainties instead of one that startles and defies us and thus opens new avenues for thought and pleasure. It now provides a spurious sense of rich complexity by reducing differences and distinctions".</p>
<p>Yet Attridge also sees space for promise in the digital development of the text, saying "The very magnitude of the encyclopedic Joycean hypertext can itself be unsettling… and it may be possible to produce a hypermedia version of <em>Ulysses</em> that is anything but reassuring—one that revives, in new ways, the provocations and disturbances of the original publication… The best teachers (like the best critics) are those who find ways to sustain the disruptive force of <em>Ulysses</em> even while they do their necessary work of explaining and demystifying". I'm hoping that by going back to my earlier definition of a participatory edition—one that functions like a classroom—we might be able to collectively make <em>Ulysses</em>' chaotic wonder accessible to more people, without also dampening that wonder.</p>
<p>So, despite there being no full digital edition of <em>Ulysses</em> against which to test these fears and assumptions about hypertextualization, we already have some questions about what happens to a complex Modernist text when “everyone shows up”, and I’m hoping that by creating a site that experiments with allowing “infinite” contextual annotation of <em>Ulysses</em>, we can get a more realistic picture of what extreme annotation actually does to our experience of the text. When even <em>Ulysses</em> editor Hans Gobbler says he still learns new things about <em>Ulysses</em> from time to time, I’m confident that <em>Ulysses</em> will persist as always partially unfixed, always giving back more.</p>
<h2>How does this work as a dissertation?</h2>
<p>The Infinite <em>Ulysses</em> digital edition is a dissertational project. In addition to the Drupal edition site, which will include the theme design, module coding in JS and PHP, and incorporated user feedback, the overall project has four other deliverables:</p>
<ol>
<li>Public code repository and documentation on using my code to build a similar digital edition</li>
<li>Formal usability study</li>
<li>Regular blogging on the technical and theorizing processes</li>
<li>Scholarly digital article built from the blog posts and the usability study</li>
</ol>
<p>So why this format and these methodologies? My primary field of interest is textual studies, a sub-field within literary studies that concerns itself with the scholarly acts of editing and edition-making, as well as preserving literary texts; more specifically, I’m interested in digital editing, which migrates these traditional scholarly practices to the online world, opening up possibilities for new ways of reading and studying literary texts. Much of the recent activity in textual studies as a discipline has followed this path, as an examination of the program for the annual Society for Textual Scholarship conference would confirm.</p>
<p>I feel that the most productive and efficacious (in terms of scholarly impact) way to push the current research, reading, and teaching capabilities of the digital edition further is to actually demonstrate them in practice, through the hands-on work of designing, building, and testing a digital platform for new editing practices. In many respects, my project is not much different from the previously accepted practice of producing for the literature dissertation a scholarly edition, complete with commentary and editorial apparatus.</p>
<p>In a field concerned with scholarly editing and edition-making, we need editions that experiment boldly not <em>only </em>with the editing of texts, but also with the crafting of those textual frames, treating the edition interface as an argument and meta-text worthy of experimentation and innovation.</p>

    <p>I recently spent some time installing <a href="http://islandora.ca/" >Islandora</a> (Drupal 7 plus a Fedora Commons repository = open-source, best-practices framework for managing institutional collections) as part of my digital dissertation work, with the goal of using the <a href="http://editingmodernism.ca/" >Editing Modernism in Canada</a> (EMiC) digital edition modules (<a href="https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_critical_edition" >Islandora Critical Edition</a> and <a href="https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_critical_edition_advanced" >Critical Edition Advanced</a>) as a platform for my <a title="Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition" href="/2013/06/25/iufeatures/" >Infinite Ulysses</a> participatory digital edition.</p>
<h2>Why Islandora?</h2>
<p>For various reasons having to do with the focus and scope of my particular dissertational project, I didn't ultimately end up using Islandora or the EMiC modules for my digital edition (e.g. I don't need the Fedora Commons extra database and collection management abilities to work with my single text, and I need installation to be lightweight and easy so others can replicate my site)—but I spent enough time with them to know they're fantastic tools for creating an online scholarly collection of critical text- or image-based editions. Here's some highlights of what Islandora plus the EMiC modules can let you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload and OCR your texts!</li>
<li>Batch ingest of pages of a book or newspaper</li>
<li>TEI and RDF encoding GUI (incorporating the magic of <a href="http://www.cwrc.ca/projects/infrastructure-projects/technical-projects/cwrc-writer/" >CWRC-Writer within Drupal</a>)</li>
<li>Highlight words/phrases of text—or circle/rectangle/draw a line around parts of a facsimile image—and add textual annotations</li>
<li>Internet Archive reader for your finished edition! (flip-pages animation, autoplay, zoom)</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/" >Fedora Commons repository</a> managing your digital objects</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, <a href="https://github.com/Islandora?query=" >Islandora has a slew of active repositories</a> for additional features, such as integrating Solr search and ingesting web archives, as well as <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA712/Solution+Packs" >solution packs</a> for handling many types of digital object (newspapers, large images, audio, PDFs, video...)</p>
<h2>How do I set it up?</h2>
<p>You'd want to start with <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA712/Islandora" >the Islandora wiki </a>for both installation instructions and answers as to what Islandora is and what it can do; there's also the <a href="http://islandora.ca" >main Islandora site</a>. Other places to look for help include the main <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora" >Islandora listerv</a> for Islandora users, the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora-dev" >Islandora Dev listserv</a> (if you're looking for help in developing on Islandora), and listservs for any particular pieces of the installation process that give you trouble (e.g. I found the <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/community/developers/devlist" >Fedora Commons developer mailing list</a> and the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/djatoka/index.php?title=Main_Page" >Adore Djatoka wiki</a> helpful, as well as <a href="http://asingh.com.np/blog/fedora-commons-installation-and-configuration-guide/" >this blog post on Fedora set-up</a>).</p>
<p><strong>BUT FIRST!</strong> While the Islandora wiki instructions will help you install Islandora on your own server, I'd highly recommend trying two other tactics first—because regular installation requires a lot of sysadminy folderol (fine and great fun if you're a sysadmin or interested+have the time in picking up some new knowledge in that area). Islandora's a fantastic platform, but the main problems I ran into while installing and playing with it were server configuration ones: finding the right paths, selecting the right versions of software, setting permissions correctly.</p>
<p>I didn't find that following the wiki straight through resulted in a working site; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to find fault with the official documentation, though!: documentation is very difficult with a thing like Islandora because many server configs are different, dependencies develop new versions, packages cease to be available (Something I've learned from creating user documentation for BitCurator is that we have to write documentation for things not even in our suite of tools or they can be major stumbling blocks to people using our software—stuff like getting 7-zip to decompress a file, or VirtualBox to recognize a given USB stick). The page on <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA711/Installing+Solr+and+GSearch" >setting up Solr and gSearch</a> was a particular stumbling point for me and others, and I'd recommend you'd start by reading the comments at the bottom and then doing a quick search on the Islandora listserv when you get there.</p>
<h2>Start Here!</h2>
<p>1. I'd strongly recommend playing around with Islandora using the <a href="http://islandora.ca/downloads" >virtual image</a> they offer (bottom of the page) to make sure it's right for your needs.</p>
<p>2. Then, consider forgoing the wiki instruction route for this "<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/islandora/mEz2KAgVUs4" >one-click automated Islandora install</a>". I haven't tried it myself (it became available after I'd switch over to plain Drupal 7), but various users have chimed in on that thread that it works, or with questions when they ran into issues (that were quickly answered by the community). You'll need to learn Vagrant and Chef to make this route work, but that should both <em>a)</em> be less work than learning how to so the server config stuff you'd need to do for the Islandora install otherwise, and <em>b)</em> be really great in the long run for your Islandora site (Vagrant lets you not mess with the system configuration on your host computer and quickly deploy a local dev site to the public). Also, it looks like that thread instructs you on the stuff you'd need to learn about Vagrant/Chef.</p>
<h2>Setting up Islandora without Vagrant or the VM: Random Notes</h2>
<p>If you want to set up Islandora using the wiki instructions (rather than using the Vagrant route mentioned above), I've compiled below random notes I took during my set-up process. These are meant as supplementary to the Islandora wiki and listserv and in no way can be followed on their own to set up your site—but it seemed worthwhile to share somewhere as one possible reference if you run into issues while setting up your Islandora site. Caveat emptor: as I mentioned, I'm no longer working on an Islandora site for my dissertation project, so I won't be able to answer any Islandora-y questions. If you do have any questions specifically about using Islandora for digital edition sites, <a href="http://editingmodernism.ca/contact-us/" >get in contact with the excellent people at Editing Modernism in Canada</a>, who have been developing the modules to add those editing capabilities.</p>
<h2>My Server Set-Up</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.linode.com/" >Linode</a> to set up Virtual Private Server (VPS) with Islandora and was very happy with their services. If you're used to using regular web hosting, the difference with a VPS is that you have access to a "whole server", so you can fiddle around with what version of PHP is installed, etc. Linode was not only reliable and fairly-priced, they have <a href="https://library.linode.com/" >truly amazing documentation</a> on how to set up your server—so don't be hesitant over creating your own Islandora site just because you've never used a VPS or set up a server before—Linode can walk you through it. Additionally, there's <a href="http://feross.org/how-to-setup-your-linode/" >this blog post</a> by Feross Aboukhadijeh on "How To Set Up Your Linode For Maximum Awesomeness" to further help you with your Linode set-up. I'd recommend starting by getting a basic Ubuntu 12.04 server set-up by following the Linode instructions (also check out their set of "stackscripts" that automate things like setting up LAMP on your server).</p>
<h2>Random Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>I found it extremely helpful to keep a written log of everything I was doing: things I tried, files I altered, paths to error logs I'd want to be checking, tutorials I'd tried (I also started auto-saving my command line input). I decided to cut a lot of that out for this post because it was very specific to my server config and needs (and also contained some trial and error and exasperated comments...), but I'd strongly encourage you to do the same. I'd never forced myself to keep such thorough notes on what I was doing before, and I'll be doing it in all my tech work from now on. You're going to have a million passwords you'll need to record anyway (Tomcat user, Drupal, Drupal database, Fedora database...)</li>
<li>Always check out the ReadMe for any Islandora/EMiC module you're installing (i.e. on the GitHub repository page for the module, scroll down past the file list to read the text, or look for the text file labeled README in the module folder you downloaded). There are often additional instructions beyond the usual way you install a module (e.g. dependencies to install, permissions to set).</li>
<li>I wanted to use the Drupal maintenance page module to hide my site from the public, but this prevented me from setting clean URLs on the site, which is required to make Islandora work.</li>
<li>I started seeing a problem where Fedora kept crashing/closing down on its own (which I could see by going to the yoursite.com:8080/fedora/admin page and not seeing the Fedora dashboard. This was solved by adding more memory to the server (i.e. purchasing a higher Linode plan, in my case).</li>
<li>Be mindful of what pieces of the platform need what version of Java. Running $FEDORA_HOME/tomcat/bin/startup.sh at one point, the output showed me that my JRE_HOME variable was pointing at the Java 6 OpenJDK, when it needed to be accessing the Sun JRE. I have a hazy memory that there's one piece of the Islandora set-up that requires one version of Java, and another that needs a different version.</li>
<li>Some random "where is that again?" notes:
<ul>
<li>yoursite.com:8080/fedora/admin (your Fedora Repository admin dashboard)</li>
<li>yoursite.com:8080/fedoragsearch (your Fedora gSearch admin; credentials are set in $FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora-users.xml)</li>
<li>yoursite.com:8080 (your Tomcat manager; set an admin user in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml and you can log in to view various processes running on your server)</li>
<li>Check out $FEDORA_HOME/data/fedora-xacml-policies/repository-policies to make sure your Fedora access policies are secure</li>
</ul>
</li>

    <p>Today, I’m participating in a panel on “What Does a 21st Century Dissertation Look Like?” in the University of Maryland English Department; we’ll explore various ways of conceiving a humanities dissertation other than the traditional monograph format. I’ve captured some notes from my talk here, as well as some related tweets and reading on the subject of non-monograph dissertations.</p>
<p>My focus is on digital dissertations that aren’t auxiliary to or duplicated by a monograph, especially those where design and building are the main scholarly methodologies. Note that there are other examples out there of non-digital yet non-monograph humanities dissertations, such as <a href="http://spinweaveandcut.blogspot.com/">Nick Sousanis’ comic-form dissertation</a>, and a number of dissertations that combine a monograph with a digital component (such as <a href="http://drum.lib.umd.edu//handle/1903/9160" >Tanya Clement's digital editing and visualizations</a>, or <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1903/13969" >Lisa Rhody’s topic modeling</a>).</p>
<p>A digital dissertation like mine <strong>is one of many equally valid options for dissertations</strong>; <strong>it’s a useful thought exercise for any dissertator to argue for the rightness of their chosen dissertational platform</strong>, regardless of which format they choose. I'm going to talk about the format that was right for my scholarly project, but my specific format is right for a specific intellectual query.</p>
<p>I’ve met surprisingly little resistance to choosing a unique format, more curiosity and willingness to understand. Most people are happy to support a project where you’ve obviously thought hard about how best to make your dissertation a contribution to scholarship. I think a lot of the misunderstanding around "whether" digital work can be scholarly stems from the different types of digital work out there (Also, from Wordles. Wordles!): sometimes you build a digital tool that requires further (often written) analysis to produce the intended knowledge, and sometimes, as when the intended knowledge deals with the use and effects of digital interfaces, the digital object itself can embody the argument. One study requires a written narrative; the other embeds its narrative.</p>
<h2>Why my format?</h2>
<p>My primary field of interest is textual studies, a sub-field within literary studies that concerns itself with the scholarly acts of editing and edition-making,  as well as preserving literary texts; more specifically, I’m interested in digital editing, which migrates these traditional scholarly practices to the online world, opening up possibilities for new ways of reading and studying literary texts. Much of the recent activity in textual studies as a discipline has followed this path, as an examination of the program for the annual Society for Textual Scholarship conference would confirm.</p>
<p>The most productive and efficacious (in terms of scholarly impact) way to push the current research, reading, and teaching capabilities of the digital edition further is to actually demonstrate them in practice, through the hands-on work of designing, building, and testing a digital platform for new editing practices. In many respects, my project is not much different from the previously accepted practice of producing a scholarly edition, complete with commentary and editorial apparatus, as a dissertation.</p>
<p>My <a href="/2013/06/25/iufeatures"><em>Infinite Ulysses</em></a> participatory digital edition pursues a speculative experiment: what if we build an edition and <em>everyone</em> shows up and adds their annotations (interpretations, questions, contextualizations) to the text? Combining an unusually complex text (James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>) with an approach imagining thousands of site users and annotations allows for the exploration of questions from overlapping fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Textual studies:</strong> How can we create digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and the lay person in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning?</li>
<li><strong>Information science:</strong> How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (e.g. upvoting, tagging) to create reading and research experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of contextual annotation quantity but also quality, customizing the displayed annotations to the interests and experience of each reader?</li>
<li><strong>Literary studies:</strong> What happens to complex texts—especially those Modernist novels purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic—under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com" >read more about Infinite Ulysses here</a>, starting with <a title="My Digital Humanities Dissertation: Building Code, Design, and Games for Textual Knowledge and Participation" href="/2013/04/09/dhdissintro" >this post about my overall dissertational agenda</a> and <a title="Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition" href="/2013/06/25/iufeatures" >this post outlining what Infinite Ulysses will actually look like and do</a>.</p>
<h2 id="docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-18dd-0124-5648-838d2267d7be">My dissertation’s format</h2>
<p>The deliverables I'm preparing:</p>
<ol>
<li>The<em> Infinite Ulysses</em> participatory digital edition (Drupal 7 site: theme design, module coding, interface behavior and incorporated user feedback)</li>
<li>Public code repository and documentation on using my code to build a similar digital edition</li>
<li>Formal usability study</li>
<li>Regular blogging on the technical and theorizing processes (on this site!)</li>
<li>Scholarly digital article built from the blog posts and the usability study (the article will exist as an interactive website that also serves as a gathering point for links to the other pieces of the dissertation; <a title="Designing a digital scholarly article" href="/2014/03/31/html5scholarlyarticle">see this post</a> for more on the argument-through-visual-design format of the planned article)</li>
</ol>
<p>The article will include a scholarly introduction and conclusion to the entire body of dissertation research, a log of critical questions and challenges that arose during the design and coding processes, quantitative and qualitative analysis of user testing of the digital edition, and a theoretical discussion situating my work as developing a long tradition of editing and literary theory.</p>
<h2>How to do something similar</h2>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-18df-bf56-16f9-3a1513cde668">I’ve written posts on <a title="Five Tips for Getting Started on a Digital Humanities Dissertation" href="/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation">getting started on a digital dissertation</a> (e.g. what should you do before submitting your prospectus?) and <a title="Digital dissertation deliverables (and how to complete them!)" href="/2013/08/14/timeandscope" >keeping up with your digital dissertation work</a>. Once you're convinced the format you've chosen is the best way to convey your dissertational argument, you'll want to draft short explanations (about a paragraph each) of what the format you wish to use is (defining any technical terms) and why you need to use it. Then, identify the parties from whom you need buy-in to make the dissertation work (both in terms of getting it officially accepted by the school, and to make sure your advisers are fully behind your decision) and share these drafts with them.</p>
<p>At my university, I spoke with my advisor, dissertation committee, and department before submitting my prospectus; I also met with the person in charge of ingesting dissertations at the university library and the dean of the humanities school. Whenever possible, keep a written record of your statement of what your dissertation will consist of as well as these interested parties' agreements to that vision. I'm lucky in encountering thorough support from the people I spoke to, but I've heard of other students having trouble late in the process when different parties expected different amounts of work to be produced for the degree.</p>
<h2 id="docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-191b-d75c-6a01-2d8347cc73ec">Benefits of a well-chosen dissertation format and/or a non-monograph format</h2>
<p>1.<strong> Justifying the format of your work is a useful thought exercise.</strong> Choose how you best think through and convey your critical thinking so that you end up with the best possible support for your scholarly argument (e.g. I’ve always left seminar discussions with ideas for small digital tools that could answer a question I'm wondering about, so exploring a digital dissertation was obvious for me.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What format best supports what you’re arguing?</li>
<li>What format best reaches the most people who can use and build on your work? (other students, scholars, interested public)</li>
<li>If you used a different format, what would be possible? What would you lose and gain? What would you learn?</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Your dissertation isn't just a piece of scholarly work; it's also a representation to your future coworkers and collaborators of <strong>who you are and what you can do</strong>. Use the dissertation to prepare for the job you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider learning a new skill(s) as part of the process (but see the caveat below): a technical skill (PHP), delivery (develop an informal blogging voice that helps you think through scholarly questions more quickly), etc.</li>
<li>Use the dissertation to develop polished examples of your existing skills to highlight when on the job market</li>
<li>Think about practicing job-skills that the degree doesn’t otherwise guarantee you (e.g. collaboration)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-1925-e8c0-c132-8e543db4353e">Challenges of non-monograph/digital dissertations</h2>
<p>1. You could end up doubling your labor and time to degree, if any of the various parties in the path to a degree (committee, department, grad school...) will only let you pursue a digital component in addition to a monograph, or if you don't clearly set (in writing if possible) the size and scope of your deliverables early in the dissertation process.</p>
<p>2. If you're going to learn new skills as part of the dissertation, make sure your goals are reachable without much outside support. The best skills to work on are self-teachable and proximal to current abilities; for example, I'm already a professional web developer with PHP experience, but I'm using the dissertation to try some advanced things with the language.</p>
<p>3. Mentors might not be able to assist or review different forms as they can with a written chapter; it's more likely your advisors will be able to evaluate your end product, but not comment on the cleanliness, security, or critical thinking behind the lines of code (or comparable facets of other dissertational approaches).</p>
<p>4. Does the job you want/places you’re interested in working value the methodologies/forms you’re using if you aren't working on the traditional monograph? Some won’t, and the economic reality is that you're probably okay with taking a job at one of these places.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you want in your peer teachers? For example, if you'd want your department to hire fellow teachers who are good and generous collaborators, how is your dissertation supporting that same quality in you?</li>
<li>If you can't do the type of project you really want to do now, consider that you may never be able to: as an adjunct, junior faculty member, up for tenure review are not more friendly or safe times for innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Dissertating can be lonely: you've reached the point of expertise where there are few people to talk to on your specific topic, and you're done with regular classes. Not sharing a common format with other students amplifies that loneliness and makes benefiting from the assistance that is available (such as writing groups) difficult.</p>

<h2>Some examples of critical thought during digital work</h2>
<p>"Those outside DH often underestimate the theoretical sophistication of many in computing, who deal every day, for example, with gaps between complex datamining algorithms and the practical sources of those data, or with the production of multiple, sometimes contradictory, visualizations from the same dataset. They know better than many of their humanist critics that their science is provisional and contingent, and that the results of research require interpretive acts."</p>

<p>“Once I was presenting<a href="http://www.eafsd.org/"> The Early American Foreign Service Database</a> and got the question “So where is the theory in all of this?” Before I could answer with my standard, diplomatic but hopefully thought-provoking, response a longtime digital humanist called out “The database is the theory!
