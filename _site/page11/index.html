<p>I'm working on web design/dev, usability, documentation, and community-building for the project.</p>
<h3><strong></strong>Ethics for Digital Forensic Archival Work</h3>
<p>I've been reading up on digital forensics in the archive, and one of the most interesting topics to me is how digital archivists explain the full possibilities of digital forensics work to potential donors—when an author brings an archive the laptop they used to draft a famous novel, how do archivists go about concisely but ethically explaining what kind of knowledge future researchers could potentially extract from their data? (I'm fully confident in the ethics of archive professionals; I'm just wondering how such risks are concisely explained and contrasted against potential future benefits of handing over a lot of an author's personal data. What do donor agreements for digital gifts look like? I did some research!) The limitless possibilities for working with all the data on an author's laptop fascinate me—with the author's drafts alongside her emails, music playlists, calendar schedules, and every other aspect of modern life people keep on their computers, <strong>you could potentially draw out a detailed illustration of that author's writing practices (did they write only in the middle of the night? how did email arguments with publishers affect the amount of creative work they were getting done?), or track down just when some crucial idea was first typed and saved (while listening to a certain album? after visiting certain pages on Wikipedia?).</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, all this possibility for recreating the context of authorial processes feels a lot more creepy when it concerns people alive today, not some Victorian author whose letters, date book, and diary were recovered from an attic. Best practice dictates that developing a relationship of trust with the donor and thoroughly documenting their wishes in a written donor agreement can go a long way toward helping future archivists evaluate whether new data analysis techniques would be in keeping with the donor's privacy needs. <a href="http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub149" ><em>Digital Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections</em></a>, a white paper by Matthew Kirschenbaum, Richard Ovenden, and Gabriela Redwine, explores this ethical issue as well as others. In this paper, Cal Lee provided an impressive list of hidden forms of data lurking just in the Microsoft Office Suite:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Forms of data that may be hidden from users include information about the application used to create a document; authors, user names, organizational affiliations, and author history; comments; custom properties; database queries; embedded objects (OLE); Fast Save—that is, change history appended to the end of a file, rather than applied to the body of a document; the GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) for the originating computer; hidden cells, slides, and text (purposely hidden but then possibly forgotten); Outlook (e-mail) properties and routing slips; path information, including audio and video paths, author history, linked objects, printers, hyperlinks, and included fields; presentation notes; printer driver information; RSID (Revision Save ID), which differentiates changes from different editing sessions); tracked changes (added to PowerPoint and Excel in Office XP) versions; Visual Basic code, including macros and viruses (and the identity of the code’s creators); Web server information; and white text (on white background). (List provided by Cal Lee. Pages 45-46 in <a href="http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub149" ><em>Digital Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections</em></a>, a white paper by Matthew Kirschenbaum, Richard Ovenden, and Gabriela Redwine)</p>
<p>While it's important to get across the full extent of risk when handing over storage devices to research archives, it's also important to show the benefits of providing seemingly unimportant contextual data to future researchers. <em>Digital Forensics</em> mentions that Emory uses the phrase "data analysis" instead of "digital forensics", as becoming the subject of a forensics investigation sounds much less inviting than having the context of one's authorial process recreated and explored.</p>
<p>I looked over the donor agreements MITH created for Deena Larsen and Bill Bly's gifts to our collection of pioneering e-lit and digital writing context; <em>Digital Forensics</em> also linked to some online examples of donor agreements, including</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/appendices/gift-agreement.html" >The Paradigm Project</a> (archives from major UK political parties)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.opendoar.org/tools/en/policies.php">OpenDOAR</a>, (the Directory of Open Access Repositories) which offers a nice checkbox questionnaire to help you generate your own digital materials donor agreement</li>
<li><a href="http://variablemediaquestionnaire.net/" >The Variable Media Questionnaire</a>, an environment for recording descriptive information about born-digital materials, including interviews with creators that allow a case-by-case record of what authors identify as the significant properties of their creative digital work</li>
</ul>
<p>This last project takes an interesting stance on digital preservation, helping archivists record how and if they want the object to be emulated or otherwise recreated in the future: "The variable media paradigm also asks creators to choose the most appropriate strategy for dealing with the inevitable slippage that results from translating to new mediums: storage (mothballing a PC), emulation (playing Pong on your laptop), migration (putting Super-8 on DVD), or reinterpretation (Hamlet in a chat room)."</p>

        Thinking Through Making: More Precedents for Scholarly Experimentation as Critical Work

    <p>I've <a title="Experimental Editions: Digital Editions as Methodological Prototypes" href="/2013/06/26/experimental-editions">written previously</a> about how experiments and new methods with textual editions and tools function as scholarly arguments; in this post I'll give a few more examples of how experimental humanities building beyond digital editions can act as critical argument. I'll also discuss precedents for dissertational making as scholarship that doesn't require duplication in monograph form. Hoping these provide a starting place for others building an argument for starting similarly practice-focused dissertations!</p>
<h3 >Speculative computing and timely experiments</h3>
<p>“Speculative computing” is a flavor of digital humanities that emphasizes the subjective, the aesthetic, and the non-computational in humanities computing work. While on the one hand relying on an experimental or provocational approach somewhat unfamiliar to the traditional humanist, speculative computing is a response to what humanists saw as the loss of subjectivity and aesthetics experienced by the humanities as it came into contact with the algorithms, code, and objectivity of computer science (Drucker, Johanna. <em>Speclab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing</em>. University of Chicago Press, 2009.) (Burdick, Anne, et al. <em>Digital_Humanities</em>. MIT Press, 2012.). A similar approach, speculative design, imagines future challenges and opportunities—as with my designing a digital edition that could handle a hypothetical public wildly interested in annotating a complex text—and builds design solutions both imbued with theoretical innovation and the possibility of future utility (Lukens, Jonathan and Carl DiSalvo. “Speculative Design and Technological Fluency”.<em> IJLM</em> 3.4 (2012). 23-40.).</p>
<p>Less speculative, more immediately applicable experimental work is routinely pursued by major digital humanities centers such as my workplace, the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu" >Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a>. As DH centers moved from sites of service to sites of inquiry over the past twenty years, so too has humanities work shifted to include digital projects not just as means to literary understanding, but as embodying literary arguments themselves. In addition to the larger projects pursued by DH centers, smaller interventions by individuals and student groups are also common in the digital humanities; Jean Bauer’s <a href="http://www.jeanbauer.com/davila.html" >DAVILA</a> is a digital overlay for DH project databases that reveals the critical choices inherent in relational database structure to non-developers, and the Praxis Program’s <a href="http://prism.scholarslab.org" >Prism</a> visualizes the intersection of many interpretations of a common text.</p>
<h3 ><strong>Precedents for dissertational making as scholarship</strong></h3>
<p>While dissertations focused on experiments (such as medical studies or the creation of a programming language aimed at a specific computing problem) are fairly normal in non-humanities fields, a dissertation that centers itself on building as much as mine does—building that does not also require a complete doubling of work effort in the form of an accompanying book-length dissertation—is still rare within the humanities (although monographs plus digital building work has become fairly normal). This is not at all to say that such work is without precedent, of course—coding as scholarly work is largely an accepted method within the field of digital humanities. It's digital building within the strictures of the dissertation that has yet to acquire methodological normalcy, for reasons ranging from the values of the granting body (most humanities PhDs are in non-digitally centered programs such as literature and history, rather than digital humanities departments), to the problems of evaluating non-monograph writing, to the all-too-often real need to conceive one's dissertation as a stepping stone towards a tenure-track teaching job (with the risk of embarking on work that colleagues might not recognize as valid, or not know how to evaluate).</p>
<p>Even in the most traditional literature departments, though, there is a precedent for thesis work focused on producing a scholarly object instead of only a written piece; a dissertation focused on producing a scholarly edition of a literary text has long been accepted as a valid final product (I imagine the same is true in other humanities fields such as history). To illustrate the trend toward dissertations deeply intertwined with their digital components, consider a current and a former member of my department (the <a href="http://english.umd.edu" >English Department</a> at the University of Maryland): my advisor Matthew Kirschenbaum’s 1999 digital dissertation was the first at the University of Virginia and one of the first in the country, and UMD alumna Tanya Clement’s 2009 <a href="http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/9160" >dissertation</a> made strong use of digital editing and modeling tools. My diverse background in information science, web design/development, and user studies helps me pursue what is, for a humanities dissertation, a non-traditional but effective and historically inevitable method of inquiry. In my next post, I'll discuss the current conversation around non-traditional (i.e. non-monograph) forms of scholarly production: do all digital scholarly objects require a written narrative, or do some projects incorporate analysis without a side serving of text?</p>

    <p>What does a code-focused digital dissertation look like when it's done? And without chapters to divide the work ahead of you, how do you keep your doctoral research on track? I'm sharing the list of deliverables I'm creating for my dissertation, as well as some practices that have helped me keep being excited about my project and eager to continue my research.</p>
<h3>Digital deliverables</h3>
<p>My dissertation is currently divided into three major coding projects: "Infinite Ulysses", "Choose Your Own Edition", and "Material Editions" (Note: <em>I successfully defended my <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities doctoral dissertation</a> in Spring 2015. The now-available <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">Infinite Ulysses</a> site is part of that project.</em>). The coding and design in this dissertation is scholarly work exploring how digital interfaces effect our use of textual editions, so I will not be doubling this critical effort by creating the traditional monograph-length written work alongside these scholarly digital objects. There will be lots of blogging arising naturally out of the process, though, and I'll be polishing these blogs into three articles aimed at scholarly journals.</p>
<p>Since there are few if any examples of delineated digital dissertation workloads out there, I'm sharing mine both as a guide for other dissertators and as an example to show your advisor or department when attempting something similar (as this workload does come with the approval of my advisor, committee, and department as adequately fulfilling the requirements of a dissertation). My completed dissertation should consist of the following components:</p>
<ol>
<li >
<p>A written introduction to the entire dissertation’s methodology, research questions, theoretical grounding, and goals. Length estimated at 20 pages, with much of the theoretical discussion specific to each of the three projects held over to those projects’ individual introductions/about text on their websites. (Most of this written foundation was completed through my 18-page prospectus and early dissertation blogging, but I'll need to rework portions of that writing after all the work is done.)</p>
</li>
<li >
<p>For each of the three coding projects, a scholarly, article-length (30-60 page) write-up aimed at future publication, drawn largely from blogging during the code, design, and testing work on each project. Each article will include:</p>
<ol>
<li >
<p>a literature review situating the coding project as building on a tradition of editing and literary theory</p>
</li>
<li >
<p>a history of specific scholarly precedents in both print and digital space</p>
</li>
<li >
<p>research questions for the project</p>
</li>
<li >
<p>a rationale for any technical choices</p>
</li>
<li >
<p>curated selections from academic blogging completed during the building process (to record scholarly considerations as the code progresses)</p>
</li>
<li >
<p>results of a short quantitative and qualitative user study matching real scholars and students with the tool, plus next steps suggested by these results</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li >
<p>A link to a public repository containing the code for the finished projects, as well as a sandbox website(s) where the tools can be explored in either working or prototyped form</p>
</li>
<li >A written conclusion on the theoretical and practical successes, failures, and next steps for the overall dissertation project (length estimated at 15-30 pages)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Blogging!</h3>
<p>Blogging twice a month splits the brunt of content generation up over the entire course of the dissertation; this regular writing also helps me generate some interest in my work, get feedback and feature requests during the initial design phase, and feel accountable to my self-imposed schedule.</p>
<p>In terms of getting writing done by typing small amounts regularly throughout my coding work, not having a huge stretch of writing waiting for me at the end of each project is nice, but even better, capturing what I've been thinking about during each stage of the process will render my final record more accurate (and useful to other dissertators) than trying to remember what the process felt like, where I got stuck, and when I was struck with new ideas. Because the process of critical building is as important as the product, using the blogs to set down and recognize how things are going before a final debriefing helps the entire process truly be a critical one.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-agility</h3>
<p>While working on a Braille translation plugin for <a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/3-1/making-the-digital-humanities-more-open-modeling-digital-humanities-for-a-wider-audience/" >Making the Digital Humanities More Open</a>, MITH's Software Architect Jim Smith taught me some elements of a work process drawn from agile software development that have been a great help in organizing my dissertation work and keeping the dissertation from (thusfar) being a stressful process. One of the techniques Jim shared was a way of scheduling work that kept priorities on the top of the work pile, while also allowing breathing room, preventing late-nighters, and otherwise recognizing human limits. With my dissertation, I've applied this technique by</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>setting monthly milestones</strong> (what tasks could reasonably be done by the end of the month?);</li>
<li><strong>prioritizing tasks</strong> by several degrees of importance (helping me identify what things I should expend extra energy to finish if they're not complete at the milestone, and what tasks might end up being out of the project's scope—a real help with a project that has so many possible features!); and</li>
<li><strong>breaking work into sprint-like microtasks</strong> by assessing the difficulty of each task, estimating the time it will take to complete (and then often multiplying that by two), and making sure each task fits into at most four hours of work (if something sounds like it will take longer than four hours, it needs to be broken into smaller tasks).</li>
</ul>
<p>This process helps me have a sense of what <em>needs</em> to be complete by the end of the month for the project to move on, and what things would only be nice to have finished by that time (and if they're not, they get dropped, not pushed into next month's task list and making it even bigger and less manageable). I'm sure there are other great ways to organize your dissertation tech work (true agile development, for example)—but these three steps help me regularly reassess my work as well as regularly reward myself for my work through free time: if I finish all my assigned tasks in a week, I stop working on the dissertation and do something else until the next week starts (well, that only happens sometimes—I'm also a fan of frontloading a month's work and then taking a bigger chunk of time off at the end of each month, but I only do that when I'm really enjoying the work and don't need the break).</p>
<h3 ><strong>Don't plan ahead too minutely: take your work a month at a time<br>
</strong></h3>
<p>You can create major monthly milestones for your entire project by setting a few very top-level goals, but don't spend time elaborating on the sub-tasks of later milestones; these will have changed by several months into your project and aren't worth spending time on right now.</p>
<p>While finalizing my prospectus, I did lay out a month-by-month schedule of tasks to make sure everything seemed to fit: could I time a beta release of my site to coincide with my MLA presentation/demo? was there enough time at the end of each project to not only conduct user testing, but do further code and design work in response to the tests' results? I was able to arrange the three projects so that I could spend one year on the first one (Infinite Ulysses, both the most ambitious project and the project that should be most polished by my defense), with half a year on each of the other projects allowing me to create prototypes, but not necessarily stand-alone unbreakable final products. After that initial check as to the reasonableness of my ambitions, I've focused my planning time just on that first project. At the start of each month, I plan what I want to have completed by the end of the month, adjust the monthly task list accordingly, and label my tasks by difficulty and priority. (Using TaskPaper for my private dissertation timeline is great because I can tag tasks in a variety of ways and pull them up accordingly. Just enough time for an easy task? Command-F "@easy".)</p>
<h3 ><strong>Public versus private timelines</strong></h3>
<p>I haven't announced a public timeline for release of my work yet, and don't plan to until I can see the end of the tunnel in terms of pushing the Infinite Ulysses site live. Digital work forces additional variables into the already mutable timeline of dissertating: I want to advance my technical skills with this research, so I'll be doing some things code-wise that I haven't done before and don't know how long they'll take; the time it takes to recruit site testers, run user testing, and respond to the results is unclear; and I might have so much more I want to do by the end of this first project that I decide extend it into the second year of my dissertation. One of the nuggets of tech-planning wisdom Patrick Murray-John gave the <a href="http://www.oneweekonetool.org" >One Week | One Tool</a> team was to give the public some indication of your plans for a project, but make that timeline much more high-level than the internal schedule by which the work actually gets done. Once the Infinite Ulysses site goes live, I'll post my plans in terms of taking feedback and adding requested features, but before then I'm reserving the right to take as much time as is needed to do a fantastic job. (Release hint, though: it'd be awful nice to have a beta site live when I present on the Infinite Ulysses project at MLA 2014...)</p>
<h3 ><strong>Keep your mentors in the loop</strong></h3>
<p>I've shared a GoogleDoc containing my monthly timeline (created while polishing the dissertation prospectus (A prospectus is a dissertator's written plan and rationale for her dissertation, submitted to both committee and department at the start of her work: both a roadmap and a promise)) with my advisors. While I was was out of state over the summer, it was a way to give them a sense of what I'm doing in a given month, since instead of the traditional "writing/editing a chapter" I might be messing with a local server, writing new code, designing a site, writing and running user tests, blogging... and since I leave tasks on the timeline but strike them out when they've been completed, it's a nice way for me to look back and see what I was doing at a given point (and feel a little proud for everything I've already done towards the dissertation). The shared timeline also gives me just enough of an accountability reminder that I think very hard about putting off tasks assigned for the given month.</p>

<p><em>I successfully defended my <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities doctoral dissertation</a> in Spring 2015.
