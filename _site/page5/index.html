<p>I've been thinking about specific questions I want to ask during the user testing for <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">Infinite Ulysses</a> as part of <a title="Digital Dissertation" href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">my dissertation project</a>—more specifically, Rachel's tweet had me thinking about how to describe to user-testing volunteers what kind of feedback I'm seeking.  I came up with some statements that model the types of thoughts users might have that I'd like to know about. For the first phase of beta-testing on my project, I'll ask testers some abbreviated form of:</p>
<p><strong><em>Have one of the following thoughts, or similar? Please elaborate:</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>"I wanted to see ___ but didn't / couldn't locate it / stopped looking for it even though it's probably there"</li>
<li>"This is broken"</li>
<li>"This is cool"</li>
<li>"This could be done better (by ___?)"</li>
<li>"This doesn't work how I expected (and that is good / bad /should be changed ___ way)"</li>
<li>"Where is ___ again (that I used before"</li>
<li>"This requires too many steps / is hard to remember how to use"</li>
<li>"Don't see how / why I'd use this"</li>
<li>"I'd use this ___ way in my reading / teaching / work"</li>
<li>"I gave up (where, when)"</li>
<li>"____ would make me like this site / like it better / use it regularly"</li>
<li>"I'm not interested in <i>Ulysses</i>, but I'd like to use this interface for a different novel / non-fiction text / (other thing)"</li>
<li>"Starting to read the text on the site took too long (too much to learn / too much text or instruction to wade through) / took the right amount of time (intro text and instruction was appreciated or easily skippable, or site use was intuitive enough to get started)</li>
<li>"I would recommend this site (to x person or y type of person)"</li>
<li>"The problem with this site is ___"</li>
<li>"Reading on this site would be easier if ___"</li>
<li>"I wish you'd add ___"</li>
</ol>
<h1>Testing stages for <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">Infinite Ulysses</a></h1>
<p>As I start to get all my design and code ducks in a row for this project this month, I'll be moving into a cycle of user-testing and improving the website in response to user feedback. I'll be testing in four chunks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Self-testing:</strong> Working through the site on my own to locate any really obvious issues; for example, I'll step through the entire process of signing up and reading a chapter on the website to look for problems. I'll step through the site with <a href="/2013/12/12/iuusabilitypersonasandsitecontent/">different user personas in mind</a> (imitating the different backgrounds and needs of some of my target audiences, such as first-time readers of <em>Ulysses</em> and teachers using the site with a class). I'll also apply various website assessment tools such as validators for code and accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha testing:</strong> Next, I'll run some low-stakes testing by inviting my dissertation committee, close friends, and family to break the site. This might get me to a point where the next stage of testers aren't hitting any problems big enough to take the site down or make testers wait while I take days to fix a difficult issue.</li>
<li><strong>Beta testing: </strong>I'll conduct beta-testing this fall and spring by opening the site to exploration and use by the people who have generously volunteered <a href="http://goo.gl/qtcy6" >via this sign-up form</a>. <em>Phase I</em> will take place this fall and take feedback from volunteers using the site individually; <em>Phase II</em> will take place in winter and early spring, continuing individual use of the site, and adding in people using the site in groups, such as teachers with their classes, or book clubs reading together.</li>
<li><strong>Post-release testing: </strong>I'll continue to take feedback once the site goes live for use by anyone in June 2015, although I'll need to scale down work on requested enhancements and focus on bug fixes and continued data gathering/analysis on how people use the site to read. Setting up site logging and Google Analytics on my site will help me monitor use as time allows.</li>
</ol>
<h1>User testing how?</h1>
<p>I'll be building on my user-testing experience from my master's research and the <a title="Bitcurator: Digital Forensics in the Archive" href="/2013/08/26/bitcuratordigitalforensics/" >BitCurator</a> project, as well as trying some new tactics.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380" >thesis for my information master's degree</a> involved a use study exploring how members of the public (and others with a content interest in a website, but lack of experience with digital humanities and edition/archives commonplaces) experienced scholar-focused DH sites, using the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/" ><em>Blake Archive</em></a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/" ><em>Whitman Archive</em></a> as examples. I was particularly interested in identifying small design and development changes that could be made to such sites to better welcome a public humanities audience. For my master's research, I built off existing user study metrics from a related field (learning technology) as well as creating and testing questions suggested by my research questions; feedback was gathered using a web survey, which produced both quantitative and qualitative data for coding and statistical analysis.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to further set up</p>
<ul>
<li>web surveys for willing site visitors to fill out after using the site</li>
<li>shorter web pop-up questions—only for users who check a box agreeing to these—that ask quick questions about current site use (perhaps incentivized with special digital site badges, or with real stickers if I can get some funding for printing)</li>
<li>in-person meetings with volunteers where I observe them interacting with the site, sometimes having them talk aloud to me, or with a partner, as to their reactions and questions as they use the site</li>
<li>various automated ways of studying site use, such as Google Analytics and Drupal site logging</li>
</ul>
<p>For bug reports and feature requests, site visitors will be able to send me feedback (either via email or a web form) or submit an issue to the project's GitHub repository. All bugs/enhancement feedback will become GitHub issues, but I don't want to make users create a GitHub account and/or figure out how to submit issues if they don't want to. I'll be able to add a label to each issue (bug, enhancement request, duplicate of another request, out of scope for finishing my dissertation but a good idea for some day, and won't fix for things I won't address and/or can't replicate). I'm using Zapier (a If This Then That -like service) to automate sending any issues labeled as bugs or enhancements that I want to fix before my dissertation defense to Basecamp, in an appropriate task list and with a "due in x days" deadline tacked on.</p>

<h1>User testing for the long haul</h1>
<p>I've got one major technical concern about this project (which I'll discuss in a later post), and one big research-design concern—both related to the "Infinite"-ness of this digital edition. My research design concern is the length of this user-testing; I'm pursuing this project as my doctoral dissertation, and as such I'm hoping to defend the project and receive my degree in a timely manner. Usability testing can be done over the course of a few months of users visiting the site and my iterating the design and code; testing use and usefulness, as in</p>
<ol>
<li>how people want to use the site (i.e. perhaps differently from how I imagined),</li>
<li>how people read <em>Ulysses</em> (a long and complex book which, if you're not attempting it in a class or book club, might take you months to read), and</li>
<li>what happens to a text like <em>Ulysses</em> as it accrues readers, their annotations, and the assessment the social modules lets readers place on others' annotations (the more readers and annotations, the more we can learn)</li>
</ol>
<p>are things I can begin to gather data on, and begin to speculate on what trends that data suggests we'll see, but I won't be able to give them the full treatment of years of data gathering within the scope of the dissertation. To address this, I'll both analyze the data I do gather over the course of months of user testing, and try to automate further data-gathering on the site so that I can supplement that analysis every few months or years without requiring too much effort or funding to sustain this work.</p>

<p><em>I successfully defended my <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities doctoral dissertation</a> in Spring 2015.

    <p>Attending the Scholars' Lab/NEH <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/" ><em>Speaking in Code</em> symposium</a> emphasized for me how much of a research developer's work involves tacit knowledge, and this opacity extends to scholars in general when it comes to how stuff—books, articles, projects—get made. You get semi-polished glimpses of a work becoming itself, from its beginnings (grant applications, abstracts) to the draft stage (actual drafts, as well as blog posts and conference talks feeling out the research) to the end point (white papers, finished products, and sometimes <a href="http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/15/llc.fqu026.abstract" >honest discussions of a project's struggles</a>). But what does doing this work look like on a daily basis?  What tools do you use, and where, and when? <a href="http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/on-tradecraft-and-track-changes/" >Matthew Kirschenbaum writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #888888;">Nobody teaches you how to write a book. Yes, in graduate school, you may get “feedback” on your dissertation to a greater or lesser extent from mentors and peers. But that typically has very little do with the process of executing on a marketable book project. (Kirschenbaum, <a href="http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/on-tradecraft-and-track-changes/" >blog post</a>)</span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/on-tradecraft-and-track-changes/" >Kirschenbaum's post</a> attempts to improve on this lack of example for how scholarly work gets done, discussing practical details of his book-writing process such as citation management. I've tried to emulate this example-sharing by blogging about my dissertational process, from the technical choices I've made to the theoretical questions I'm considering. In this post, I've asked myself what I'd like most like to learn about others' DH work set-up, and decided that the physical and screenspace environments, most-used software and websites, and work habits were the aspects I would most benefit from seeing other examples of. I'll describe the workplace set-up, schedule, and software that help me make progress on my <a title="Digital Dissertation" href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com" ><em>digital dissertation</em></a> project and its <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">Infinite Ulysses</a>, with the hope of hearing more from others about the day-to-day environment and behavior that produces their digital humanities work.</p>
<h2>Workspace</h2>
<p><strong>MITH. </strong>I'm in residence at MITH as the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/mith-welcomes-amanda-visconti-as-winnemore-fellow/" >Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow</a> this academic year, and the plan is to do most of my remaining dissertation work at the office. MITH is generally either quiet or has a pleasant hum, but sometimes I'll block out sounds while I'm blogging or on a particularly frustrating problem. I saved up for some noise-canceling headphones, which are pretty magical at producing quiet even when I've been trying to work in an airport. In the past, I've used cheaper but still useful alternatives such as earplugs or normal headphones playing free white noise. <a href="https://www.coffitivity.com/" >Coffitivity</a> is great when you want want something a little more realistic in the background.</p>
<p>I use an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse, both for the extra screen space and to position everything at the optimum height for my wrists and neck.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/mithwinnemoredesk.jpg" alt="A photo of my fellowship desk at MITH, Fall 2014." width="474" height="355"></p>
<p><strong>Home. </strong>I worked entirely at home over the summer, but my set-up there is pretty similar (external monitor, desk/chair/externals adjusted to promote good posture/happy muscles).</p>
<p>In terms of screen space usage, I'll have one Chrome browser window open with a number of tabs up (or two separate windows if I want to separate research/question-solving from website work), as well as a minimized Firefox window (for checking site design and script using the plugin Firebug). I'll also have a text editor open with several different code files I'm working on or consulting, and the GitHub for Mac application open for committing (saving/uploading) new code to my private dissertation code repository (to be made public soon).</p>
<h2>Work schedule</h2>
<p><strong>Time. </strong>I have the most energy in the morning; I was the kind of person who preferred taking classes in the 8am slot during college. Being up early lets my day start at a slow pace, and I have a bit of time by myself to get into a good working frame of mind and plan what I want to accomplish that day.</p>
<p>I get to MITH a little before 8 A.M. and stay until I hit a good stopping point for the day, either mid- or late afternoon. I do this for four consecutive days a week, with some extra email/organization/reading work on those evenings after I go home and try to jog. On the remaining three days, I try to do nothing related to the dissertation, focusing instead on fun projects (creating a new theme for this blog, learning to bake really good bread, trying to increase my running distance, learning Go). So far, this is a great schedule: I get way more done than if I try to say "I should be working on my dissertation 40+ hours a week and on every single day!", and I'm always refreshed and excited to get back to my research after a few days resting my brain with other things. I think I'd allow myself to work on one of these days off if I was really excited, but I never want to feel like I need to; getting my project done a bit sooner isn't worth burning out or not being able to think about anything but my project.</p>
<p><strong>Scheduling tasks.</strong> I previously used <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper" >TaskPaper</a>, a task list app from the makers of the distraction-free writing app <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom" >WriteRoom</a> (which really helped with writing my candidacy exam presentation!), to keep track of what I needed to do on my dissertation. That got a bit unwieldy. I've recently switched to keeping a TaskPaper list for things I want to do on non-dissertating days (so I can write them down and not have them distracting me), and using <a href="http://www.Basecamp.com" >Basecamp</a> to manage teaching and research tasks. <a href="http://www.trello.com/" >Trello</a> is a good, free alternative, but I ended up finding the set-up for Basecamp matched the structure of my task list a bit better (I'm also more used to Basecamp from using it for MITH projects).</p>
<p>On Basecamp, I've attempted to break down everything I need to do in the remaining year (knock on wood) of my dissertation into small tasks, then added a date to the tasks I want to complete in the next month, so I can filter to a view of just what I need to accomplish today or this week in order to stay on track. Checking off tasks is pretty gratifying, and having a clear overview of what needs to be done by what point (after first, of course, creating a project timeline that I could reasonably follow, with a lot of empty buffer time at the end for all the things I can't plan for) keeps me from getting stressed about what I haven't done yet—if I complete the tasks I need to do this week this week, I know I'm on schedule.</p>
<p>Within a given week, I try to vary between coding-focused days and other activities such as organization of tasks and URL bookmarks, blogging, and reading/research. I generally start the week with coding so that if a problem proves frustrating, I can switch to a non-code day to clear my mind before trying to figure out the issue again.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p><strong>Citations. </strong>I've managed citations in the past with the free and awesome <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" >Zotero</a> (e.g. for my master's thesis), and I expect to do so again once I start creating <a title="Designing a digital scholarly article" href="/2014/03/31/html5scholarlyarticle/" >my final article about my project</a>. If you do a lot of your research on the Web, Zotero is fantastic—you can use it to pull citation info from a page you're reading, as well as take a snapshot of the page in case it disappears later.</p>
<p>Research for me right now means a mixture of theoretical articles (e.g. papers about the social reception of <em>Ulysses</em>, or studies on meaningful crowdsourcing for the humanities, or blog posts), example digital editions and other digital textual work (e.g. Alan Galey's <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/index.html" ><em>Visualizing Variation</em></a>), and support for my research coding/design (e.g. code snippets, the Drupal <a href="https://drupal.stackexchange.com/" >StackExchange</a>, tutorials, and documentation). I initially saved these bookmarks into various folders, but the folder names at the start of my project proved to be way too vague and all-encompassing two years down the road ("Scholarly Sources to Read", anyone?). I recently re-organized these so it's easier to find what I need, with more specific folder titles.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/IUbookmarks.png" alt="Screenshot of Chrome bookmarks menu with folders for various dissertation topics" width="401" height="457"></p>
<p>I wanted to keep the folders in a certain order, but kept losing that when I'd sort their contents by title—thus the numbering per folder. In my research resources folder, you can see some more specific sub-folders, such as one where I'm keeping track of the various digital edition and textual annotation tools I considered and tested before ending up working with Annotator.js.</p>
<p><strong>Coding.</strong> I read, edit, and write code in <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/" >bbEdit</a> (the pro version of the free <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/" >TextWrangler</a>), which has far more fancy features than I can regularly use. Features I've found useful include scripts that convert minified CSS and JS into readable, well-structured code; folding (collapsing) sections of a code file I'm not working on and don't need to see; and searching across multiple folders.</p>
<p><strong>Track changes. </strong>Keeping track of changes in my code is important for several reasons: I want to document effort for my dissertation committee (especially as my dissertation looks different than those they're used to), give proper credit and correct licensing for any pieces of open-source code I build on, and be able to roll back my code to an earlier state if I need to. I use <a href="http://git-scm.com/" >git</a> to do this, mostly through the website <a href="http://www.GitHub.com" >GitHub</a> and a GUI app (<a href="https://mac.github.com/" >GitHub for Mac</a>) that is quicker for me than using git on the command line.</p>
<p>I've started creating <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/306267" >Drupal installation profiles</a> after I make major changes to my work, so I can easily re-create my site without needing to reset all the options and reinstall various modules; eventually, I'll package all my work as a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/developing/distributions" >Drupal distribution</a>, so that anyone can spin up a participatory digital edition website like mine with no more trouble than setting up a vanilla Drupal website (and if setting up a vanilla Drupal website is difficult or unknown to you, I'll provide user-friendly instructions on that as well—or you can check out Quinn Dombrowski's awesome <a href="http://drupal.forhumanists.org/" ><em>Drupal for Humanists</em></a>).</p>
<p><strong>Command line and local work. </strong>I don't use the command line as much when I'm just working locally (i.e. on a version of the website that lives on my computer and isn't accessible on the Web), and I've been mostly working locally lately. When I need it, I use Mac's Terminal app to manage things that are easier to do from the command line than via the GUI, such as <a href="https://github.com/drush-ops/drush" >Drush</a> (a set of commands that makes doing sysadminy and developer things with a Drupal site quick), or to move files around. When I'm working on a site on the Web, I use the command line to install things, edit files, and more. When I want to work locally on my Drupal site, I use <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/" >MAMP Pro</a> (the paid version of the free MAMP), which imitates the things I'd be using on a web server to make a Drupal site work (e.g. MySQL).</p>
<p><strong>Technical support. </strong>An important piece of tacit understanding we discussed at <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/" >Speaking in Code</a> was the ability to successfully search for answers to technical problems; surprisingly, knowing how to Google well as a coder—especially when technical words have alternative popular meanings—is a difficult skill to impart. Since someone has probably encountered the same or a similar problem to yours before and written about it, and coding today is all about not re-inventing the wheel but building off of existing open-source code, knowing how to search for what you need is a vital technical skill.</p>
<p>I've been working on some of the core functionalities of my Drupal site lately (things related to highlighting and annotating text in a digital edition), so my main searches have to do with Drupal, PHP (which Drupal is largely written in), and Javascript (the core functionality of my site is provided by Annotator.js). Besides pure Googling when I hit an obstacle, I visit the Drupal.org module pages for <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/annotator" >Annotator</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/annotation" >Annotation</a> as well as their <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/annotator?categories=All" >issue</a> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/annotation?categories=All" >queues</a> (to see if anyone else has run into the same issue), and the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" >Stack Overflow</a>,  <a href="https://drupal.stackexchange.com/" >Drupal Answers</a>, and <a href="http://serverfault.com/" >Server Fault</a> Q&A sites. I'm also on the Annotator.js list-serv, which is fairly low traffic and offers a mix of news about the community of Annotator users/developers, and developer questions.</p>
<p><strong>Blogging. </strong>I've covered how I figured out what I needed to blog about in <a title="Affinity of ideas: Using an affinity wall to map out my digital dissertation" href="/2014/04/28/affinitywallarticle/">this post on affinity mapping</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm designing my <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">Infinite Ulysses</a> digital edition website (part of my now completed <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities dissertation</a>) toward including readers usually left out of critical discussions of complex texts through participatory design. One result of that thinking has been discovering multiple ways to define and address "inclusivity": inclusivity as web design that is universally accessible to users; as invitation to participation; as scaffolding to make a site not only welcoming, but usable by new community members.</p>
<p>My project is, at its core, about designing interfaces for meaningful conversations around difficult texts. I'll be learning some things about my sample text <em>Ulysses</em> along the way (what actually happens to Joyce's hypertext when it becomes digitally hypertextual and hyper-annotated?)—and using <em>Ulysses</em> as my example text is crucial to my project's success (as I'll explore more below)—but my intervention is one of inclusivity through interface design, rather than at the level of scholarly editing.</p>
<p>I'll talk about whether what I'm making is a "scholarly digital edition" in a future post (short answer: no and yes and it's complicated). Traditionally, scholarly edition work focuses on establishing for other scholars a reliable text prepared according to a rigorous methodology that intervenes at the level of textual paragraphs, words, and characters, and that isn't what I'm doing in this project. That's obviously not to say I'm presenting an unreliable text, but that my critical work and argument are bound up in the interface framing a text, and not on the level of the words on the pages (I'm using the text prepared by the Modernist Versions Project and in particular digitized by Matthew Kochis and Patrick Belk.). Although I'm departing from the usual set of scholarly actions in my edition work, instead focusing on designing for participation and exploring different categories of literary annotation, my digital edition does become part of the works making up our digital edition canon—and as such, I wanted to spend some time thinking about how this project of mine might be more inclusive as regards what authors and works are represented in the digital canon.</p>

<p>If you're interested in reading more about canon-formation—particularly in regard to the role authors' race plays in what makes it into the canon—I strongly recommend Amy Earhart's piece "Can Information Be Unfettered? Race and the New Digital Humanities Canon" (<a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/16">available in <em>Debates in DH</em> online</a>). Earhart provides a fantastic overview of the canon as it has applied to digital text projects past and present, as well as how canon-awareness might shape our future work: "the narrow digital canon should remind us why we cannot stop digital edition work".</p>
<p>Expanding on the digital text examples Earhart names, some digital editions for authors who are not cis male, white, and English-language from the top of my head plus a quick Googling:</p>

<li><a href="http://nl.ijs.si/e-zrc/index-en.html">eZISS</a>: Scholarly Digital Editions of Slovenian Literature (found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmgLcm5jfVhSdGlPNm1WQ0hRYjFTU1E5QnBDdlZMQWc&usp=drive_web#gid=0">AroundDH Global List</a> of DH Projects and Centers)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more examples (though never enough), but there is no perfect central resource for discovering all digital editions, archives, and literary engagements on the web—something that makes awareness of just what kind of digital canon we're constructing difficult. Greta Franzini has made an amazing start toward such a resource with her <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag9fg4mfdAuPdHF2Y0twOVpaYS1MbjVWY25UNFZYWFE&usp=drive_web#gid=0">Digital Edition Catalogue</a> (some <a href="http://www.academia.edu/2482066/A_catalogue_of_digital_editions">slides on the project here</a> state that one of her findings about digital edition coverage is that it's Anglocentric). If some DH body with high international visibility (ACH? ADHO? DH Commons?) were to create a way for digital editors to add to this catalog from their main website, I could see this being an ongoing and thorough resource.</p>
<h2><b>Why is </b><b><em>Ulysses</em></b><b> a problem? Why is it a solution?</b></h2>
<p>The problem with doing a digital text project around <em>Ulysses</em> is just the (perhaps obvious?) one: it's another digital edition around the well-known work of a white Anglo male writer, when the digital text canon already feels biased toward authors fitting that description (I'd love to see some stats on this, but again, we'd need to do a good job getting the word out to add any digital texts you know of to the dataset, first). Though the exact degree is uncertain, I expect there is a chilling effect to digital editions of many non-canon authors not existing, not being widely known or used, not being funded, or not being reused by other scholars and read by everyone. The body of DH work out there does say something about our valuing of inclusion: who does DH? who do DH projects focus on? who are DH projects meant to serve? who is welcomed, explicitly and implicitly? what assumptions about intellectual power and authority are invested in our designs? who gets to create a scholarly edition of x canon author? Lindsay Thomas' blog post "<a href="http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/12/16/open-access-and-the-digital-humanities/">Open Access and the Digital Humanities</a>" reminds us that "making something freely available online does not necessarily guarantee that thing is public, or that it will be used as a public resource"; <em>public</em> does not mean participatory, and likewise a project being public, participatory, diverse, accessible, or inclusive does not necessarily mean it also advances any of the other characteristics in that list. This blog post is a way for me to share some of my thoughts on making my project benefit and welcome a wide audience both for using the edition and reusing my code, and solicit feedback on making a better project.</p>
<p>I'm a Joycean as well as a textual scholar, and I'll admit it's fantastic for me that I can learn things about <em>Ulysses</em> while building to improve the public humanities. <em>Ulysses</em> is an important text for me personally: it's why I stayed in an English major despite not enjoying how most of my literature courses were taught; creating a Joyce site was a driving factor behind learning HTML and various digital art skills, which set me on the path to becoming a web developer; it's how I got into the digital humanities and found a community of people with similar interests (who knew I didn't need to choose between literature and web development?). How much do I love <em>Ulysses</em>? <a href="http://www.ulyssesulysses.com/">This much</a>, and <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/usurper/">this much</a>, and <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/fun/marionette.html">this much</a>. It's unclear to me, however, whether I'd be building a site around <em>Ulysses</em>—or any other text that's already comfortably in the canon and public view—if my project didn't call for a very specific type of text.</p>
<p>There are good intellectual reasons for creating a participatory digital edition of <em>Ulysses</em>: I've discussed precedents to a participatory digital editions of <em>Ulysses</em><a href="/2013/06/27/infinite-ulysses-background/">here</a>, and some of the scholarly questions designing, building, and testing such a site can help me explore <a href="/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro">here</a>. Many of these scholarly questions could be explored with other texts, though. For example, a participatory edition of Djuna Barnes' <em>Nightwood</em> could help me explore how hypertextualizing/hyper-contextualizing already-hypertextual Modernisms affects the text, but I'd run up against copyright issues that <em>Ulysses</em> no longer faces (Well, the 1922 Shakespeare and Co.'s public domain status in the U.S. is "contested", so that's not <em>completely</em> true.), but more importantly I wouldn't be able to attract enough readers to support the main focus of my research, interfaces for participatory critical discussion.</p>
<p><em>Ulysses</em> is special. What other difficult texts are so much in the public consciousness? <em>Hamlet</em>'s a play, religious texts are divisive, <em>Finnegans Wake</em> is <em>too</em> difficult. But <em>Ulysses</em> is difficult enough that everyone's glad for help in reading it (you're missing out if you're not reading some side material to find out about its legal history, interpretation, and context), but reading it is also a reachable goal—a marathon of the mind, if you will. People hold reunions with the book clubs they read <em>Ulysses</em> with decades ago, tweet their frustration and triumphs during the reading experience, and celebrate a yearly holiday on the day the book is set (mark your calendars! Bloomsday is June 16, a date also important in Joyce's courting of his partner Nora Barnacle). As such, it's the perfect text for testing an interface supporting active public conversation around a difficult book:  a book that's widely known as both difficult and beloved.</p>

<p>My approach to designing for critical participation hinges on user-testing, as well as a speculative experiment imagining how the site would handle millions of users and annotations. To test the site's usability and usage by real readers and gain meaningful insight not just into the Infinite Ulysses site, but into how any similarly participatory digital edition might be designed, I need to use a text that people are this excited about reading, that they've already heard of but haven't read (or want to reread)—and I can't think of another text that fits this need like <em>Ulysses</em> does.</p>

<p>My research hinges on having my site used, and being able to understand what people want in their reading of a difficult text through that use. The Ransom Center has <a href="http://blogs.utexas.edu/culturalcompass/2014/01/20/archivist-declares-medieval-manuscript-fragment-crowdsourcing-project-success/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=archivist-declares-medieval-manuscript-fragment-crowdsourcing-project-success">shown that the public is interested in participating in a project with a not-radically-popular focus</a>—identifying medieval manuscript fragments:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Now, 369 images, several conference presentations, and more than 67,000 views later, there’s evidence that crowdsourcing can work with even the most archaic of subjects. Twenty-eight individuals (from amateur enthusiasts to established scholars) contributed to the project by providing input via comments on the Flickr page. A number of other individuals assisted through emails or phone calls. Thus far, 94 of the 116 identifiable fragments have been identified, and nearly 57 percent of those were identified through crowdsourcing (by date, region, or the text itself). —<a href="http://blogs.utexas.edu/culturalcompass/2014/01/20/archivist-declares-medieval-manuscript-fragment-crowdsourcing-project-success/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=archivist-declares-medieval-manuscript-fragment-crowdsourcing-project-success">Micah Erwin</a></em></p>
<p>Projects like <a href="http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/"><em>Transcribe Bentham</em></a> and the NYPL Lab's <a href="http://menus.nypl.org/"><em>What's On the Menu?</em></a> and <a href="http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/"><em>Building Inspector</em></a>, too, show that public DH is very possible, but these are still fairly few projects with strong institutional backing rather than the work of a single junior scholar; these examples are heartening, but not enough assurance for me to base my project around a text without <em>Ulysses</em>' popular allure. For a site that requires repeated visiting and extensive online reading (Something everyone seems to "know" is unpleasant, but spend all their time doing anyway... I'll be interested to see via user-testing how much reading online is actually an issue, and whether the iPad/tablet version of the site allows more comfortable reading), <em>Ulysses</em> is a necessary choice.</p>
<h2><b>What I'm doing to make my project more inclusive</b></h2>
<p>Here are some of my ideas toward making my project more inclusive, for the multiple meanings of the word:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design with first-time readers of the novel in mind. Survey people who've read the novel on what tripped them up and what places in the novel were especially hard; focus annotation efforts on places readers identified as where they gave up reading the novel.</li>
<li>Make the interface as intuitive as possible, and test it with visitors who aren't use to DH or other academic sites to make certain you're not taking certain navigation commonplaces for granted. Create multiple paths for starting to use the site so that readers can jump right in, read suggestions for site use, or watch a short video tour for the site.</li>
<li>Welcome use and input from all readers frequently (on the front page, and at greater length on another page) and sincerely (back up the claim that everyone's contributions to the conversations are important by highlighting contributions from diverse categories of user).</li>
<li>Explore mechanics for rewarding site use (such as highlighting a user's annotations for viewing by other readers) based on activity level and depth/quality of content, rather than outside identity (e.g. submissions by "amateur" readers vs. tenured scholars as identified in user profiles) to encourage welcoming conversation about the novel from diverse readers.</li>
<li>Create safe, private mechanics for asking questions. Make routes for feature requests and bug reporting simple and obvious.</li>
<li>Design the site to be as universally accessible as possible given dissertational time constraints. Test the site with various available tools (pa11y, screen readers, grayscale and high contrast color palettes). Research how similarly complex interfaces (e.g. library catalogues) address usability. Use an <a href="https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-public/labels/inclusion%2Fuse%20barrier">"inclusion/use barrier" label</a> in the site's GitHub issues repo to highlight bugs and feature requests that address accessibility.</li>
<li>Consider user privacy (allow pseudonyms? option to keep annotations private? option to make annotations that are questions private?), but make sure any option for privacy doesn't discourage users from being part of the public conversation.</li>
<li>Consider a reverse speculative experiment of no one using the site (or people reading but not contributing annotations) so that the site is just as useful for a few lone users (a useful experiment even if many eventually use the site, since the site has to start with someone being the lone user even if super-briefly).</li>
</ul>
<p>And a couple ideas that specifically address inclusivity and the digital text canon of which this project is part (a short list that I hope to lengthen!):</p>
<ul>
<li>The premise of the site—a public, participatory conversation around a complex text—augments canon interpretations of the novel by inviting infinite annotations from diverse readers. I can support this further by creating a reading list resource for readers who want to explore existing interpretations of <em>Ulysses</em>, along with highlighting which interpretations have been historically popular, and examples of viewpoints that haven't yet been a large part of the conversation.</li>
<li>Document my work and release my code so other scholars can easily spin up a participatory edition on any writer or topic, not just canon ones. Encourage this usage by suggesting complex, conversation-worthy texts outside the canon and in the public domain (especially when there's already a reliable prepared text freely available for use).</li>
<li>In my guide to using the site for teaching, suggest lesson ideas for discussing the issue of canonization of Modernist voices, certain lines of interpretations, and of digital text creation.</li>
<li>Suggest possible uses of my code/design work to expand the canon. One model I admire is the <em>Shelley-Godwin Archive</em>, a participatory scholarly edition site that focuses on a circle of writers, some more and some less canon, creating a site that highlights a network rather than a single author.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tactics from Existing Digital Communities</h2>
<p>Part of my work is to repurpose things that are already working in non-scholarly digital communities that handle user-generated text. To that end, a few ideas I've drawn from around the Web...</p>
<p><a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal's home page</a> (scroll to the bottom) includes a world map that shows where Drupal community activity is happening (possibly in real/near-to-real time?). It might be welcoming to <em>Infinite Ulysses</em> readers to have some sort of similar reflection of the diversity of the site's community.</p>
<p>My site will include a welcome statement on the front page as well as a longer page discussing inclusivity, the site moderation system, and community behavior. I'll model these texts on wording from sources like the <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/#inclusivity">Speaking in Code website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AdaInitiative/tools/tree/master/conferences/sample-policies">the Ada Initiative's sample conference policies</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/2013/12/16/speculative-experiment-useful-here-and-now">I've previously discussed</a> StackExchange's "<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">theory of moderation</a>", which grants progressive privileges as your participation on the site increases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users with 15 rep can flag posts.</li>
<li>Users with 2,000 rep can edit any question or answer in the system.</li>
<li>Users with 3,000 rep can cast close and open votes.</li>
<li>Users with 10,000 rep can cast delete and undelete votes on questions, and have access to a moderation dashboard.</li>
<li>Users with 15,000 rep can protect posts.</li>
<li>Users with 20,000 rep can cast delete votes on negatively voted answers. (Jeff Atwood, "<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">A Theory of Moderation</a>")</li>
</ul>
<p>SE's moderation rules are a great step toward basing community authority on participation, but there are still ways that it could fail at inclusivity;  some who want to take part in the community might not have the time or the internet access to establish commitment this way. I want site visitors to be able to use the full features of the site from their first visit, but I might be able to model some site behavior (e.g. what user content gets automatically highlighted on the front page?) on SE's plan.</p>
<h2>Suggestions?</h2>
<p>It's important to me to make the <em>Infinite Ulysses</em> site as welcoming, supportive, and otherwise accessible as possible, and to more broadly advance how we design and promote public, participatory DH. Have any ideas for <em>Infinite Ulysses</em> or toward making digital editions in general more participatory? Maybe you've run into an issue in another digital edition or archive that you'd like to see addressed? I'd added a space for sharing suggestions and requests related to inclusivity and accessibility in my sign-up form for beta-testing the site, but you should now feel free to tweet me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Literature_Geek">@Literature_Geek</a> with any questions or follow me to hear when the website goes live.</p>
