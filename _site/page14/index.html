    <p>Yesterday's post introduced some of my research questions with the "<a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro">Infinite</a> <em>Ulysses</em>" project; here, I'll outline some specific features I'll be building into the digital edition to give it participatory capabilities.</p>
<p>This project combines its speculative design approach with the scholarly primitive of curation (dealing with information abundance and quality and bias), imagining scholarly digital editions as popular sites of interpretation and conversation around a text. By drawing from examples of how people actually interact with text on the internet, such as on the social community <a href="http://www.reddit.com" >Reddit</a> and the Q&A <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com" >StackExchange</a> sites, I'm creating a digital edition interface that allows site visitors to create and interact with a potentially high number of annotations and interpretations of the text.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>So that readers on the beta-site aren't working from a blank slate, I'll seed the site with annotations that offer a few broadly useful tags that mark advanced vocabulary, foreign languages, and references to Joyce's autobiography so that the site's ways of dealing with annotations added by other readers can be explored. Readers can also fill out optional demographic details on their account profiles that will help other readers identify people with shared interests in or levels of experience with <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>On top of a platform for adding annotations to edited texts, readers of the digital edition will be able to:</p>
<p><strong>1. tag the annotations</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For Stephen's description of Haines' raving nightmare about a black panther, a reader might add the annotation "<em>Haines' dream foreshadows the arrival of main character Leopold Bloom in the story; Bloom, a Jewish Dubliner, social misfit, and outcast from his own home, is often described as a sort of 'dark horse'</em>". This annotation can be augmented by its writer (or any subsequent reader) with tags such as "JoyceAutobiography" (for the allusions to Joyce's own experience in a similar tower), "DarkHorses" (to help track "outsider" imagery throughout the novel), and "dreams".</p>
<p><strong>2. toggle/filter annotations both by tags and by user accounts</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Readers can either hide annotations they don't need to see (e.g. if you know Medieval Latin, hide all annotations translating it) or bring forward annotations dealing with areas of interest (e.g. if you're interested in Joyce and Catholicism)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Readers can hide annotations added by certain user accounts (perhaps you disagree with someone's interpretations, or only want to see annotations by other users that are also first-time readers of the book).</p>
<p><strong>3. assign weights to both other readers' accounts and individual annotations</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As with Reddit, each annotation (once added to the text) can receive either one upvote or one downvote from each reader, by which the annotation's usefulness can be measured by the community, determining how often and high something appears in search results and browsing. Votes on annotations will also accrue to the reader account that authored those annotations, so that credibility of annotators can also be roughly assessed.</p>
<p><strong>3. cycle through less-seen and lower-ranked editorial contributions</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To prevent certain annotations from never being read (a real issue unless every site visitor wishes to sit and rank every annotation!)</p>
<p><strong>4. track of contentious annotations</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To identify and analyze material that receives an unusual amount of both up- and down-voting</p>
<p><strong>5. save private and public sets of annotations</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Readers can curate specific sets of annotations from the entire pool of annotations, either for personal use or for public consumption. For example, a reader might curate a set of annotations that provide clues to <em>Ulysses</em>' mysteries, or track how religion is handled in the book, or represent the combined work of an undergraduate course where <em>Ulysses</em> was an assigned text.</p>
<p>I'm expecting that the real usage of these features will not go as planned; online communities I'm studying while building this edition all have certain organic popular usages not originally intended by the site creators, and I'm excited to discover these while conducting user testing. I'll be discussing more caveats as to how these features will be realized, as well as precedents to dealing with heavy textual annotations, in a subsequent post.</p>
<h2>First Wireframe</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/IUwireframe1.jpg"></p>
<p>In the spirit of documenting an involving project, here's a quick and blurry glance at my very first wireframe of the site's reading page layout (a higher-res, readable wireframe with a walkthrough should follow in the next few weeks). I thought of this as a "kitchen sink wireframe"; that is, the point was not to create the final look of the site or to section off correct dimensions for different features, but merely to <em>represent</em> every feature I wanted to end up in the final design with some mark or symbol (e.g. up- and down-voting buttons). The plan for the final reading page is to have a central reading pane, a right sidebar where annotations can be authored and voted up or down, and a pull-out drawer to the left where readers can fiddle with various settings to customize their reading experience (readers also have the option of setting their default preferences for these features—e.g. that they never want to see annotations defining vocabulary—on their private profile pages).</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to finessing this layout with reader feedback toward a reading space that offers just the right balance of the annotations you want handy with a relatively quiet space in which to read the text. This project builds from the HCI research into screen layout I conducted during my master's, which produced an earlier <em>Ulysses</em> digital edition attempt of mine, the 2008/2009 <a href="http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com" >UlyssesUlysses.com</a>:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="/assets/ulyssesulysses1.jpg"><br>
UlyssesUlysses does some interesting things in terms of customizing the learning experience (choose which category of annotation you want visibly highlighted!) and the reading experience (mouse over difficult words and phrases to see the annotation in the sidebar, instead of reading a text thick with highlightings and footnotes). On the downside of things, it uses the Project Gutenberg e-text of <em>Ulysses</em>, HTML/CSS (no TEI or PHP), and an unpleasant color scheme (orange and brown?). I've learned much about web design, textual encoding, and <em>Ulysses</em> since that project, and it's exciting to be able to document these early steps toward a contextualized reading experience with the confidence that this next iteration will be an improvement.</p>
<h2>Possibilities?</h2>
<p>Because code modules already exist that allow many of these features within other contexts (e.g. upvoting), I will be able to concentrate my efforts on applying these features to editorial use and assessing user testing of this framework. I'll likely be building with the Modernist Commons editing framework, which will let me use both RDF and TEI to record relationships among contextualizing annotations; there’s an opportunity to filter and customize your reading experience along different trajectories of inquiry, for example by linking clues to the identity of Bloom’s female correspondent throughout the episodes. Once this initial set of features is in place, I’ll be able to move closer to the <em>Ulysses </em>text while users are testing and breaking my site. One of the things I hope to do at this point is some behind-the-scenes TEI conceptual encoding of the Circe episode toward visualizations to help first-time readers of the text deal with shifts between reality and various reality-fueled unrealities.</p>
<h2>Practical Usage</h2>
<p>Despite this project's speculative design (what if everyone wants to chip in their own annotations to <em>Ulysses</em>?), I'm also building for the reality of a less intense, but still possibly wide usage by scholars, readers, teachers, and book clubs. This dissertation is very much about not just describing, but actually making tools that identify and respond to gaps I see in the field of digital textual studies, so part of this project will be testing it with various types of reader once it’s been built, and then making changes to what I’ve built to serve the unanticipated needs of these users (<a title="DH Evaluation: A Four-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work" href="/2012/10/31/3partdheval" >read more about user testing for DH here</a>).  Tomorrow and Thursday, I'll be discussing precedents for the project's use of the edition as an experiment, as well as some caveats and unknowns I'll be facing as I continue this work.</p>

<p>Digital humanities productions are increasingly sites of broader participation in textual interpretation, with how to evoke and harness "meaningful" crowdsourcing becoming an increasingly urgent question to scholars seeking a more public humanities.</p>
<p><img alt="First slide from my presentation on the Infinite Ulysses project." src="/assets/ulyssesfirstslide-300x165.jpg" width="300" height="165"></a> (CC BY-NC Amanda Visconti)</p>
<p>In <a title="Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design & the Urgency of the Public Humanities" href="/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities">a previous post</a>, I discussed how borrowing the HCI idea of "participatory design" can help DH practitioners and their public audiences to mutual intellectual gain. As we use the Web to open the texts we study to a wider community of discussion, bringing in diverse knowledges and interpretive biases, I’m interested in how we can usefully structure the overabundance of information proceeding from public contextual (Contextual annotation = notes that give a context for a word, phrase, or other chunk of text, ranging from definitions of advanced vocabulary to more interpretive annotations)<strong></strong> annotation of literary texts. That is: my "Infinite <em>Ulysses</em>" project is conceived as an idealistic speculative or thought experiment: what if we build an edition and everyone shows up and adds their annotations to the text? When this quantity of voices is combined with an unusually complex text such as James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>, how might we create a critical experience that adeptly handles not only issues of contextual annotation <em>quantity</em> but also <em>quality</em>?</p>
<p>I've previously blogged about the overarching plans for my digital dissertation: about how <a title="My Digital Humanities Dissertation: Building Code, Design, and Games for Textual Knowledge and Participation" href="/2013/04/09/dhdissintro">I'm empirically testing both current and personal theories about textuality through code and design</a>, and how I'm designing this building-as-scholarship <a title="Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design & the Urgency of the Public Humanities" href="/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities">towards helping everyone</a>—textual scholars and the lay person—participate in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning. This post is about the first of my dissertation's three coding projects: designing and coding an interface that allows a participatory, vibrant, contextualizing conversation around complex Modernist texts, with <em>Ulysses</em> being my main focus. Packed into one sentence, my research question for this first project is: <strong>What might we learn from crafting an interface to usefully curate quantity and quality of contextual annotation for complex Modernist digital editions (such as <em>Ulysses),</em> where the critical conversation is opened to the public?</strong> That's a long sentence covering both more abstract and more concrete critical work, and I'll be breaking it into manageable chunks with the rest of this post and those to follow.</p>
<h2>“Infinite” annotations.</h2>
<p>While there isn’t a complete digital edition of <em>Ulysses</em> yet published, that hasn’t kept Joycean scholars from anticipating issues that might arise with the eventual migration to digital space. Where the limitations of print space have in the past kept annotations of the text in check, what will happen when a digital platform allows the addition and navigation of infinite annotations? Can we migrate complex print hypertexts such as<em> Ulysses</em> to a digital space with socially multiplied annotations without, as Mark Marino wonders, "diminish[ing] the force of the book" (Mark C. Marino, "Ulysses on Web 2.0: Towards a Hypermedia Parallax Engine"):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Assuming it were possible, would the creation of a system that automatically makes available all the allusions, unravels all the riddles, and translates foreign languages normalize Joyce's text? (Marino)</p>
<p>In <em>Joyce Effects: On Language, Theory, and History</em>, Derek Attridge similarly sees a risk in <em>Ulysses</em>' hypertextualization:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[<em>Ulysses</em>'] cultural supremacy, and the scholarly efforts which reflect and promote that supremacy, have turned it into a text that confirms us in our satisfied certainties instead of one that startles and defies is and thus opens new avenues for thought and pleasure. It now reassures us of our place in what might otherwise seem a chaotic universe, or it provides a model of coherence to take a refuge in, a satisfying structure where the details all make sense… a spurious sense of rich complexity by reducing differences and distinctions (Derek Attridge, <em>Joyce Effects: On Language, Theory, and History</em>, 185)</p>
<p>Yet Attridge sees space for promise in the digital development of the text as well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The very magnitude of the encyclopedic Joycean hypertext can itself be unsettling… and it may be possible to produce a hypermedia version of <em>Ulysses</em> that is anything but reassuring—one that revives, in new ways, the provocations and disturbances of the original publication... The best teachers (like the best critics) are those who find ways to sustain the disruptive force of <em>Ulysses</em> even while they do their necessary work of explaining and demystifying (Derek Attridge, <em>Joyce Effects: On Language, Theory, and History</em>, 186-188)</p>
<p>Despite there being no full digital edition of <em>Ulysses</em> against which to test these fears and assumptions, we already have some questions about what happens to a complex Modernist text when “everyone shows up”, and I’m hoping that by creating a site that experiments with allowing “infinite” contextual annotation of <em>Ulysses</em> (that’s where the “Infinite <em>Ulysses</em>” title of my project comes from), we can get a more realistic picture of what extreme annotation actually does to our experience of the text. When even <em>Ulysses</em> editor Hans Walter Gabler can still learn new things about <em>Ulysses</em> (Digital Ulysses Master Class with Hans Gabler, June 2013) , I'm confident that Ulysses will persist as always partially unfixed, always giving back more.</p>
<h2>Quantity and quality, signal and noise.</h2>
<p>While the final effect of unlimited space to discuss and interpret the text remains to be seen, the "Infinite <em>Ulysses</em>" project will also tackle two more immediate problems: quality and quantity of annotation. If everyone’s submitting annotations to a digital edition, how can we automate the massive task of curation and moderation so that it occurs in a timely and unbiased manner? And once we’ve separated the wheat of critical yet diverse annotations from the chaff of repetitions, spam, and under-substantiated suggestions, how do we make the still-plentiful remaining material accessible to the users it would best serve? That is, how do we separate the signal from the noise when the “signal” of pertinent contextual annotations means different things for different reader needs?</p>
<p><strong>So: what happens to a complex Modernist text when we allow "infinite" annotations on it, and how do we work with "infinite" annotations to filter, order, and display those annotations best suited to a given reader?</strong> Tomorrow's post will explain the specific features I'm coding into my interface to approach these questions.</p>

    <p>THATCamp Prime 2012 happened to fall on Bloomsday last year, so a bunch of us—Ben Schmidt, Chad Rutkowski, Anastasia Salter, Heather Prescott, and me (Amanda Visconti)—jumpstarted a small infoviz project: a visualization of character interactions in James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>. In keeping with the spirit of Molly Bloom, we said <strong>"O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images"</strong>--creating a way to see at a glance which characters are most social, who interacts with whom, and what type of interactions different characters have throughout the course of the Dublin day. We ended up producing <a href="/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis">a basic visualization of character interactions in the "Wandering Rocks" section.</p>
<p><img alt="Wandering Rocks visualization" src="/assets/wanderingrocks1-300x204.png"></p>
<p>For this year's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday">Bloomsday</a> (Sunday, June 16th, 2013), I'm gauging interest in helping expand our visualization to other pieces of the book: i<del>f I get enough responses (3? 4?),</del> I'll write up an easy-to-follow tutorial and assign participants small sections of the book to cover (I'm happy to let people indicate a section of interest, of course--but with a number of people working together, my assigning pieces will help us a) not do redundant work and b) produce data that covers complete sections of the novel instead of random pieces with large gaps in-between (and a visualization is more intuitive and useful if we can say "this shows character interactions in chapter 1-4" instead of "character interactions on pages 22-37, 56-61, ...."). I'll keep an updated list of unclaimed sections, too, in case anyone feels inspired to do extra work :) ).</p>
<p><strong>What's involved? It's super easy</strong>--<em>no knowledge</em> of information visualization is required to participate, and although a basic familiarity with <em>Ulysses</em> (i.e. having read the section you're working on once before) will make your work a bit faster because you can scan the pages for people interacting instead of read them, <strong>it's fine if you're reading Ulysses for the first time</strong> (welcome to awesomeness--and I'll have something neat for you to check out in the fall! (One of my digital dissertation coding projects is building a participatory digital edition interface for Ulysses aimed at a helpful, customized reading experience for first-time readers of the novel. Tweet me @literature_geek to be added to the list of future beta-testers!) ).</p>
<p><strong>The work is super simple:</strong> you'll fill in a spreadsheet each time two characters have some sort of interaction (i.e. every time two characters run into each other--not every sentence spoken in a dialogue), taking down the names of each pair of characters and the type of interaction they have (we've got codes for seven somewhat arbitrary types of interaction, from 1 "character is thinking of another character" to 7 "character having intimate contact with another character"). I'll create a tutorial blog post and/or video before Bloomsday that walks you through what to do, and I'll drop everyone's work into an information visualization program to produce the visualization. As a gauge for the amount of information you'll be taking down, the "Wandering Rocks" section--possibly the most interaction-intense section of the book except for "Circe"--had 43 interactions by our count. If you're just scanning the pages for character interactions instead of reading, you can spend as little as 10-20 minutes covering a section of the book.</p>
