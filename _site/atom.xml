   <id>/2016/08/19/DH-consultation-notes-teaching-omeka</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I provide DH consultations via email or in person, I try to also share the resources mentioned as a blog post here when they seem broadly useful. These notes aren’t representative of everything available on a topic, just some info for those new to a topic getting their feet wet. See this blog’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/advice-tutorial/&quot;&gt;advice category&lt;/a&gt; for more posts with advice and tutorials, and let me know if you’d like more in-depth resources around a specific DH topic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the best online lessons I know of are these two on the peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons&quot;&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; website: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka&quot;&gt;Up and Running with Omeka.net&lt;/a&gt;” by Miriam Posner, followed by “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit&quot;&gt;Creating an Omeka Exhibit&lt;/a&gt;” by Miriam Posner and Megan R. Brett. These do a thorough walkthrough of setting up and filling out your Omeka website (and include frequent screenshots!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you know where you want students to create their websites?&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve found the easiest thing is having each student create an account on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omeka.net/&quot;&gt;Omeka.net&lt;/a&gt; using the free plan (500MB storage, 15 available plugins that add extra site features, and 5 themes that change the look of your site). An Omeka.net account gives each student a free Omeka website (at something like mycustomtitle.omeka.net) , plus &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.omeka.net/&quot;&gt;lots of documentation&lt;/a&gt; for any questions that come up. Some examples of Omeka.net sites are &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.omeka.net/showcase/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that Omeka.net is different from Omeka.org&lt;/strong&gt;; Omeka.net lets you build Omeka sites right on the Omeka.net website, while Omeka.org is the Omeka code, which you can download and on your own server to have more control and customization options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more in-depth project where students would want to be altering Omeka code, installing the code on their own web server, using plugins (things that add features like commenting) or themes (change the look of your website) not available on Omeka.net, or purchasing and using a more customized domain name (MyCustomSite.com instead of MyCustomSite.omeka.net), you’d want to explore the resources on Omeka.org. This is considerably more technically intensive than using Omeka.net and is comparable to running your own WordPress blog instead of using WordPress.net (if you’re familiar with those). But! For both Omeka options (.net and .org), there’s amazing and thorough documentation, user forums, and tutorials focused on teaching with Omeka; you just need to decide how much effort you or your students want to devote to web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do choose Omeka.org&lt;/strong&gt;, your university IT may or may not be willing to install the code for you on your free university web space (like Drupal or WordPress, Omeka requires not just web code but a database). If the cost is not prohibitive, I highly recommend considering pointing students to &lt;a href=&quot;https://reclaimhosting.com/&quot;&gt;Reclaim Hosting&lt;/a&gt; instead; this gives them greater control over their website, especially after they graduate or otherwise leave the university. Reclaim has &lt;a href=&quot;a $25/year option&quot;&gt;a $25/year option&lt;/a&gt; that includes excellent custom service knowledgable about academics’ needs, a free custom domain name (e.g. MyCoolOmekaSite.com), and installation of Omeka at the push of a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few additional resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amanda French’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandafrench.net/2013/11/12/introduction-to-omeka-lesson-plan/&quot;&gt;Omeka lesson plan&lt;/a&gt; (detailed outline for what to cover in class when introducing Omeka)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Miriam Posner’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/&quot;&gt;How did they make that?&lt;/a&gt;”, a blog post showing several DH projects (including an Omeka one) and explaining in non-technical language the tools and work involved in creating each project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/files/docs/OmekaWorkshopTipSheet.pdf&quot;&gt;This Omeka PDF&lt;/a&gt; has links for understanding Omeka terminology like metadata and Dublin Core&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://teachinghistory.org/digital-classroom/tech-for-teachers/25115&quot;&gt;This lesson&lt;/a&gt; at TeachingHistory.org is another option for getting started with Omeka&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeffrey W. McClurken on “&lt;a href=&quot;http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/teaching-with-omeka/26078&quot;&gt;Teaching with Omeka&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/codex/Teach_with_Omeka&quot;&gt;Some examples&lt;/a&gt; of Omeka class projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sheila Brennan’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/blog/2013/08/20/back-to-school-edition-use-omeka-in-your-class/&quot;&gt;Omeka resource roundup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alexandra Bolintineanu’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://omekagym.omeka.net/about&quot;&gt;Omeka Gym&lt;/a&gt;, a website collecting Omeka assignments, resources, examples, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more excellent Omeka resources out there, so if you’re seeking help with something specific, consider an online search to turn up the many Omeka-focused teacher’s blog posts and presentation, then posting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.omeka.org/&quot;&gt;Omeka’s support forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Digital Humanities What, Why, & How (DLF eResearch Network Talk)</title>
   <link href="/2016/07/21/dlf-digital-humanities-what-why-how"/>
   <updated>2016-07-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/07/21/dlf-digital-humanities-what-why-how</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I gave the following talk on the what, why, and how of digital humanities to the Digital Library Federation (DLF) Research Network on July 20, 2016 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clir.adobeconnect.com/_a960001693/p9qmqw2b9w5/?launcher=false&amp;amp;fcsContent=true&amp;amp;pbMode=normal&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clirdlf/eresearchnetwork/blob/master/syllabus-ern-2016.md#digital-scholarship-digital-humanities-data-visualization&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt;). The audience was librarians interested in digital things, but this talk is broadly applicable; if you’re a grad student or thinking about becoming one, though, you might also be interested in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/grad-advice/&quot;&gt;posts on doing DH as a student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;on my now-completed DH literature dissertation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m going to share my personal answers to some related digital humanities (or “DH”) questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what&quot;&gt;What is DH?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#why&quot;&gt;Why can DH be good for my work, for my department, and for my university?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how&quot;&gt;How can I get started in DH?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide01.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing DH definitely is: overly defined. The website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.WhatIsDigitalHumanities.com&quot;&gt;WhatIsDigitalHumanities.com&lt;/a&gt; currently offers over 800 definitions of DH submitted by DH practitioners. Definitions of this field maybe aren’t hugely helpful in understanding it, but I’ll start with one anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide02.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital humanities takes the work already done in the humanities (that is, research, teaching, and learning in areas like literature, history, and the arts; everything related to our past and present cultural heritage). But! It does this work in digital ways, such as making and using computer software, websites, and mobile phone apps to teach, or to help researchers and learners…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide03.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nuance of this definition is that DH is not just about using digital tools and methods and formats in humanities work; it’s also about applying humanities thinking to the digital. For example, a DHer might think through what a feminist social media platform would look like, or look for the hidden interpretative work that goes into creating a shiny map of political opinions in America. What gets represented, and why? What gets elided and glossed over?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StewartVarner&quot;&gt;Stewart Varner&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stewartvarner.com/2016/01/what-dh-could-be/&quot;&gt;a great blog post&lt;/a&gt;) points out that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://viraltexts.org/&quot;&gt;Viral Texts project&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryancordell&quot;&gt;Ryan Cordell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasmiq&quot;&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of this kind of DH. They’re using an algorithm to discover texts that were routinely reprinted in 19th-century historical newspapers—that is, discovering historical memes! After discovering where and how texts were reprinted and passed along among newspapers, they’re applying non-digital literary scholarship to studying why these texts were reprinted, and what their paths of dissemination might mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide04.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third nuance of what DH is, is that it’s as much about a distinct community and its values, as it is about DH methods and output (check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mkirschenbaum&quot;&gt;Matthew Kirschenbaum&lt;/a&gt;’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/kirschenbaum_ade150.pdf&quot;&gt;What Is Digital Humanities and What’s It Doing in English Departments?&lt;/a&gt;”). DH is defined by communities of practice, whether those are of shared methods, research questions, values, or something else. I’ll show you some examples of those values in just a moment, but I do want to say that when I talk about DH community, my view is limited by my own experience, which has included a specific subset of DH using Twitter, and the projects and people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/&quot;&gt;MITH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://chnm.gmu.edu/&quot;&gt;CHNM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/&quot;&gt;Scholars’ Lab&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhsi.org/&quot;&gt;University of Victoria’s DHSI&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhinitiative.org/&quot;&gt;DH Initiative at Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, and other groupings where I’ve either worked, attended an event, or used a tool or project created by that grouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples always help me, so I’ll discuss three particular DH projects in more depth a little later in this talk. When I was getting started in DH, though, the thing that helped me feel like I had an understanding of this weird amorphous interdisciplinary field, was just to hear about a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of different projects, and spend some time being &lt;em&gt;gobsmacked&lt;/em&gt; by the many things doing DH could mean. So I’m going to zip through a handful of the many many things DH can be right now, before going into any level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide17.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DH can look like…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the University of Michigan’s team work on increasing digital access to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lib.umich.edu/islamic/&quot;&gt;Islamic manuscripts&lt;/a&gt;, where scholars have digitized texts’ pages and commenters can add scholarly transcriptions and annotations to help others understand these texts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coding &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/braille/&quot;&gt;a WordPress plugin that translates blogs into Braille&lt;/a&gt;. I was on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/research/braillesc/&quot;&gt;a team of DHers led by Tina Herzberg, George Williams, and Jen Guiliano&lt;/a&gt;, who realized that so much DH thinking is shared on WordPress blogs, and that creating some code that made blog writing simple to convert into Braille output could help in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/3-1/making-the-digital-humanities-more-open-modeling-digital-humanities-for-a-wider-audience/&quot;&gt;making the digital humanities more open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/research/the-documentation-and-preservation-of-dance/&quot;&gt;a project&lt;/a&gt; that explored digital ways choreographers could notate and preserve historical dance performances (team included &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dougreside&quot;&gt;Doug Reside&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/silkroadstudio&quot;&gt;Elisabeth Kvernen&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;archaeological work excavating old buildings and recreating these lost locations as &lt;a href=&quot;http://nico-digitalarchaeology.blogspot.com/2012/09/catalhoyuk-2012-and-4d-gis.html&quot;&gt;virtual 3D spaces &lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nicolo_dellunto&quot;&gt;Nicolo’ Dell’Unto&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhinitiative.org/projects/shgis&quot;&gt;recreating lost urban spaces such as the Soweto township under apartheid regimes&lt;/a&gt; (team led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/angeldnieves&quot;&gt;Angel David Nieves&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an event like the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;THATCamp unconferences&lt;/a&gt;, which started at George Mason University’s DH center (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chnm.gmu.edu/&quot;&gt;RRCHNM&lt;/a&gt;) and now take place around the world. These are events that try to bring DHers together to talk and build in less hierarchical ways than traditional humanities conferences do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a bot, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wcaleb&quot;&gt;Caleb McDaniel&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/every3minutes&quot;&gt;@Every3Minutes Twitter bot&lt;/a&gt;, which uses social media to hammer in the crushing regularity with which enslaved people were sold in antebellum America.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a tool for doing DH work, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chnm.gmu.edu/&quot;&gt;Center for History and New Media&lt;/a&gt;’s work developing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/&quot;&gt;Omeka platform&lt;/a&gt; for online museum and archival collections. Note that making Omeka is &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; DH work: the scholarship that consisted of thinking through, designing, and building Omeka (research assistant professor and Omeka developer Patrick Murray-John discusses this work &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/theory-digital-humanities-and-noticing-by-patrick-murray-john/&quot;&gt;in this Journal of DH piece&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using a script or a program to analyze text and discover who most likely authored it, and then publishing about your research (digitally or not). The 1962 Mosteller and Wallace analyses that went into determining the disputed authorship of the Federalist Papers were computer-based. (If this approach interests you, see the free online &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&amp;amp;chunk.id=ss1-4-1&amp;amp;toc.depth=1&amp;amp;toc.id=ss1-4-1&amp;amp;brand=default&quot;&gt;Blackwell Companion to DH and its chapter on stylistic analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Hugh Craig.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DH can look at huge historical events, or it can look at large events alongside the every day, as with projects in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackpressresearchcollective.org/&quot;&gt;the Black Press Research Collective&lt;/a&gt; (a team project founded and directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blackdigitalhum&quot;&gt;Kim Gallon&lt;/a&gt;). The Collective includes work includes mapping and visualizing the historical availability of black newspapers, so that we don’t only know what was being written, but can also conjecture on who had access to reading that writing. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattdelmont&quot;&gt;Matthew Delmont&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackquotidian.com/anvc/black-quotidian/introduction?path=index&quot;&gt;Black Quotidian&lt;/a&gt; captures moments of everyday black life from the past via historical newspapers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…meta-work around the digital humanities field, as with &lt;a href=&quot;http://transformdh.org/&quot;&gt;Transform DH&lt;/a&gt;’s work toward a more diverse and inclusive DH. TransformDH is a decentralized network that includes work by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/moyazb&quot;&gt;Moya Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fiona_barnett&quot;&gt;Fiona Barnett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anitaconchita&quot;&gt;Anne Cong-Huyen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alothian&quot;&gt;Alexis Lothian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NazcaTheMad&quot;&gt;Amanda Phillips&lt;/a&gt; among others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…the design of a platform like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mukurtu.org/&quot;&gt;Mukurtu&lt;/a&gt;, which is a CMS (website platform) like Drupal or Omeka, but is explicitly built to ethically support indigenous communities in managing their cultural heritage. Mukurtu was started by members of the Warumungu community, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mukurtu&quot;&gt;Kim Christen Withey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/craigdietrich&quot;&gt;Craig Dietrich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe you use traditional non-digital methods to do and print your humanities scholarship (as much as this Microsoft Word-loving field can be non-digital), but you’re plugged into DH Twitter and find out about the latest projects, new blogged thinking, and future collaborators by being part of a digital community (for what it’s worth, that seems to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to mean that you’re doing some of your scholarship digitally). DH can mean that you actively use digital means to take part in your intellectual community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DH can look like many kinds of methods and/or publication forms, and those methods should be inclusive of all kinds of critical thinking and contributions to shared knowledge—things that don’t always get credited as scholarship but should be, like coding, teaching, cleaning your data, building bibliographies, and documentation of how to use a humanities tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Edit: Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ProfessMoravec/&quot;&gt;Michelle Moravec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/digiwonk&quot;&gt;Aimée Morrison&lt;/a&gt; for their #inclusivesyllabi tweets and work, which encouraged me to try to define DH with a diverse list of examples. Ways I can improve the list before my next talk: check if authorship %s are good, and include teaching, community &amp;amp; outside-university work, student work, &amp;amp; LGBTQ examples. I’m keeping of things I need to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/digitalhumanities/issues/7&quot;&gt;here in a GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/digitalhumanities/blob/master/DiverseDHExampleList.md&quot;&gt;updating the list as on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; so I can easily compare it to past versions as it changes over time). Suggestions for authors and representations of DH my list is missing warmly welcomed! [Note that I’m not looking for more &lt;u&gt;general&lt;/u&gt; intro to DH resources, just examples of diverse DH work that I’ve failed to represent with my list.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current suggestions from DHers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elotroalex/status/756865619757260800&quot;&gt;examples of minimal computing aka #mincomp&lt;/a&gt;, plus &lt;a href=&quot;a larger list of DH places to read/write/go/etc.&quot;&gt;a larger list of DH places to read/write/go/etc.&lt;/a&gt; both via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elotroalex&quot;&gt;Alex Gil&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-isnt-dh&quot;&gt;What isn’t DH?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all this can be DH, maybe we want to say, &lt;em&gt;fine, what isn’t DH&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that question difficult to answer concisely or usefully? But I’ll try to give an example of a thing that can both very much “be” DH, or can be a non-DH thing—with explicit emphasis that &lt;strong&gt;it’s up to the practitioner(s) in question to identify whether they, their project, and their methods “are DH”.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;I added some stuff here subsequent to my talk, as I wasn’t quite sure I’d gotten across what I wanted to say and needed to think through it more via writing; you can &lt;a href=&quot;#dh-values&quot;&gt;skip down to the “DH values” section&lt;/a&gt; if you’d prefer.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite arguments that the term DH isn’t useful if we don’t define it more rigidly than I have above—and maybe what I’ve said above, or any of the other 800+ definitions, should really be enough as a definition?–I just don’t have much use for someone declaring whether &lt;em&gt;someone else’s&lt;/em&gt; work “is DH” or not, and have trouble imagining I wouldn’t find such a declaration both wrong and disrespectful. But there are reasons to apply the term DH other than boundary-defining: sometimes we want to talk about some group of work in general, or about work for which we don’t know whether the creator would term it DH, or want to say “I’d consider this project DH [implicitly expecting that anyone involved contradicted this, they have the last word]”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I define DH in part by a willingness to partner with and borrow from all other fields. If someone expresses interest in what a community is doing and its values, they don’t need to perfectly perform all those values to have some magical judge grant them entrance to an academic field. If we all had to tirelessly adhere to rules all the time or be cast out of DH, we wouldn’t have anyone in the field, and the field would never grow. (This is, of course, a separate issue from banning people from a community who are harassers or engage in other unethical behavior.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll give an example of a DH activity that is at some times somewhat related or overlapping with DH, and at some times not DH: digitization. (I really could have picked any of a number of activities: for example, it’s pretty clear to everyone that coding can “be” DH, or it can be not DH, e.g. coding for business, science, etc.). I’m picking digitization because the general public tends to be more aware of projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt;, of scanning and putting stuff online, and less aware of research based on it (Google Books might not be the best example because of DHers’ mixed response to  &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/ngrams&quot;&gt;stuff subsequently built from the Google Books digitization&lt;/a&gt;). The public tends to know less about other DHy things, and when I mention my field I sometimes encounter people thinking that “all” DH means is scanning and uploading humanities stuff. (One problem with this: you can “just” scan and upload in exactly the same way you can “just” write a shopping list or code a science tool, or you can engage critically with the decisions this involves, etc.). Digitization is a DH method, and is often crucial, scholarly work; it’s just that digitization (or coding, or whatever other method you want to think through) is in no way &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of what DH does. Just pointing to any method (scanning, 3D modeling, coding, writing…) without the thinking and sharing that together with that method equals scholarship, is something I do run into, and I want people to be aware of the thinking and learning part of using a scholarly method, too. (More on what “scholarly method” means to me later, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital humanities isn’t so much focused “just” on digitizing things. DH projects often don’t stop at scanning and putting humanities content like historical newspapers or photos online (although they could stop there and share their learning). Rather, DH projects often do so as a way to study or improve the process of digitization, or as a prelude to additional research. DH is often focused on designing inspiring and useful ways for interacting with those online materials, once they’ve been made digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;On reflection, I shouldn’t have picked digitization as my main example, because digitization work tends to be wrongly less treated as scholarly or more poorly paid, than other can-be-DH methods like coding. I think that incorrect dynamic made this explanation less concise than it could have been&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide19.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitization can be DH, just as much as coding, teaching, writing, performing, or many other possible methods of scholarship. Rather than bulk uploading of scanned documents, a DH digitization project might, for example, be concerned with figuring out the exact lighting and scanner settings to represent a scanned manuscript online, and the people doing this might speculate about what it would mean for a scan to be a more authoritative representation of the scanned manuscript, than if that manuscript were scanned with different lighting and settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These scholars are asking, how do we best represent this physical thing digitally? What would “best representation” mean, and is there even such a thing, or is any process that involves choices subjective? People aren’t just robotically scanning and uploading stuff; even if they’re overworked and underpaid they’re developing expertise around this technical work. People care about the work they do and can’t help but think critically about the best ways to do it, and it’s weird and not useful to assume people working in the humanities in any role aren’t expert critical thinkers around the work they do. One thing I like about DH is that the community tends to be a little better at recognizing all humanities labor as the scholarship it is (versus “traditional” humanities), rather than glossing over the important, critical thinking and scholarship of people in many different professional roles (&lt;em&gt;though it’s far from perfect at this recognition, as I’ll discuss below&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dh-values&quot;&gt;DH values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, asking if something is or isn’t DH might not be the most generative question (&lt;em&gt;I guess it generated a bunch of words from my keyboard, though…)&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, we may want to ask, what do DHers care about? And how can we encourage others to care about the same thing, when that’s appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll talk a bit more in-depth about three DH projects now, to give you a sense of what some DH values look like in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide20.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the trends I’m seeing in DH is a move from making things public, to making things participatory. 10-20 years ago, there was a big emphasis on just getting transcripts and scans of texts and images online, so people who couldn’t afford to travel to see the originals could nevertheless create scholarship around these things. These projects are great gifts to the world, and the critical thinking and decisions and experiments that went into them (and continues today with digitization staff) is DH scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a basic level of creating “access” to information, where someone’s scanned something and put it online where anyone can hypothetically access it. This is the case with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/fsa/&quot;&gt;the Library of Congress’ digitization and hosting&lt;/a&gt; of the thousands of photographs taken as part of government-sponsored programs during the Great Depression and WWII. These photos have been freely available online thanks to the LOC for years, and they give a wonderful view of what daily life was like all over the U.S. during this time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the website is hard to use if you’re not used to working with research data collections every day—that is, if you’re not a researcher. And it doesn’t have tools or other design aimed explicitly at helping students and the public see why these photos are interesting and relevant to them. What the LOC staff have done (especially despite their past &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/americas-national-library-is-behind-the-digital-curve-a-new-report-finds/2015/03/31/fad54c3a-d3fd-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html&quot;&gt;problematic management&lt;/a&gt; and with limited resources) is truly amazing scholarship, so I want to emphasize that this is awesome work, and I believe we need projects aimed just at researchers just like this project is—it’s just that I want researchers to be making more things that are aimed at people besides ourselves, also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Below is a 50-second clip I made checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/&quot;&gt;Photogrammar project&lt;/a&gt;… although since this is a blog post rather than a live presentation, I highly encourage &lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/&quot;&gt;just playing around with Photogrammar yourself&lt;/a&gt;! It’s extremely intuitive and impressive.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/175695252?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;434&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/&quot;&gt;The Photogrammar project&lt;/a&gt; at Yale, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/about/team/&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laura_wexler&quot;&gt;Laura Wexler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nolauren&quot;&gt;Lauren Tilton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/statsmaths&quot;&gt;Taylor Arnold&lt;/a&gt;, is a great example of what digital humanities projects can add to the basic access allowed by digitized materials. Photogrammar is built on those thousands of Great Depression and WWII photos hosted by the Library of Congress (&lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/about/fsa_owi/&quot;&gt;the FSA-OWI collection, 1935-1944 photos sponsored by the Farm Security Administration&lt;/a&gt;). What Photogrammar does, is to add an appealing interface that makes you interested in looking at these photos, then supports you as you start to have questions you’d like to answer about the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide22.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional tools on the site help you locate the photos that would be most interesting to you, and relate to what you’re teaching or learning. For example, above is a tool that uses facial recognition to identify people in these photos, and to let you explore and question where and when these photos were taken by the subjects’ ethnicities. Another tool lets you find commonalities and differences among subsets of the photos: like what kind of photos were most often taken in California between 1935 and 1945?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the LOC ‘s project as representative of an earlier but still extremely important set of DH values: of getting stuff online in clean and accessible fashion; once more information is online, we can start to make it easier for people to do stuff with it, like Photogrammar does. Photogrammar is representative of a more recent value of DH: making the humanities not just more public, but more publicly inviting and participatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide23.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docnow.io/&quot;&gt;Documenting the Now&lt;/a&gt; is a DH project building ethical tools for preserving and including social media activism in the archive, with a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatter&quot;&gt;#BlackLivesMatter&lt;/a&gt; and related hashtags. More than just a tool, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docnow.io/&quot;&gt;DocNow&lt;/a&gt; is building a community around the difficult questions of ethically and respectfully creating a historical record of protests, including through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wk0JdF2Cty2VHMqpf_QlJXVKQdUtfeeFhaYRben3qaM/viewform&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; (a chat platform) where everyone is invited to participate in conversations around archival ethics and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DocNow’s community lead, archivist &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BergisJules&quot;&gt;Bergis Jules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BergisJules/status/755484124614303744&quot;&gt;describes the project&lt;/a&gt; as trying to make the social media and web archiving conversation and work more inclusive, and says &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; might be the most important contribution of their project, even more than the tool they create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DocNow’s lead developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edsu&quot;&gt;Ed Summers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.docnow.io/docnow-as-community-2aa13fca860f#.gtbx9a4jh&quot;&gt;describes their work&lt;/a&gt; by saying: “I think what we are hoping to do is build a tool that doesn’t just do things because it’s possible, but has some values built into it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a couple things I like about DH, and optimistically think of as representative of DH’s values: they’re documenting their thinking and decisions, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.docnow.io/&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wk0JdF2Cty2VHMqpf_QlJXVKQdUtfeeFhaYRben3qaM/viewform&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, as they go along. They’re thinking about the shortcomings of technology: what happens to discussions happening on for-profit platforms like Twitter, where video links can break, tweets can be taken out of context, and people converse without consenting to becoming part of some institution’s record? They’re thinking carefully about the ethics of what they build and what others may do with what they build, trying to be not just legal, but moral. They’ve created &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wk0JdF2Cty2VHMqpf_QlJXVKQdUtfeeFhaYRben3qaM/viewform&quot;&gt;a community space&lt;/a&gt; where anyone interested in these questions can participate in the conversation shaping the tool. And they’re working toward making the archive a better, more diverse, actively anti-racist record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide24.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final example, one of my DH projects is a website that supports collaboratively reading and interpreting a really difficult novel, James Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses.&lt;/em&gt; Above is a screenshot of the front page of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses digital edition&lt;/a&gt;. The images give a high level tour of the edition’s features: you can highlight parts of the book and annotate those highlights; read others’ annotations; and start to personalize what annotations you see to your background, interests, and needs on a very basic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project was to take a popular DH platform—the scholarly digital edition—and look at ways we can use visual and community design to invite, welcome, support, and value the contributions of non-academics in the conversations around challenging and complex literary texts. It was an experiment—I wasn’t sure what was going to happen and whether anyone would use the site. I also valued publicly documenting the design and technical choices I made throughout the project, and to not only discuss successes but also failures, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/05/12/spring-2014-tech-update&quot;&gt;the time I spent 6 months working with a platform I ended up not using in the final website&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;a blog post twice a month&lt;/a&gt; to capture this information where others could read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide25.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing access can mean reaching out farther to collaborate with audiences that aren’t as welcomed by the humanities. We want to think about the time and money required to engage with DH projects; about the bandwidth and hardware needed; about who gets to see themselves represented and spoken to. One of the failures I often hear ascribed to MOOCs, is that they don’t actually open up learning to people who didn’t already have some other option in terms of accessing higher ed resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As happy as I am with how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; has reached a variety of readers outside academia, of all ages and from around the world, there are two big things I’d like the project to do better. The first is to design to invite and support readers who don’t already have other alternatives for making their way through Joyce. And the second goal is to make this bigger than &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;: I was able to draw over 20 thousand site unique visitors because people have heard something about James Joyce and &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s a big problem if what we create and encourage people to visit online just recreates the canon of print books (and a related problem that huge numbers of site visitors doesn’t mean people who stay and enjoy the project). As much as I like &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, I want to figure out what readers on my site like about the novel, and then point them to less-canon texts that do similar things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide26.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I talk about why you might want to be involved in the digital humanities, I tend to speak toward the good and ideal of DH, and the DH I want to see. But DH isn’t some magical anomaly. It’s a community of people from a lot of fields, with a lot of subfields of its own, and it shares many of the same problems as humanities fields, something the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23transformdh&quot;&gt;#TransformDH hashtag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://transformdh.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; are working on. I encourage you to check out the Twitter hashtags on the screen for some useful conversations around problems in DH, including issues at the yearly big DH conference that took place last week—the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/arc.html?key=1zlUFubccXY7Pekfs0bXgxzIbNalJPGvU_SJIlmLTI50&amp;amp;gid=400689247&quot;&gt;#DHdiversity hashtag&lt;/a&gt; (archive captured by &lt;a href=&quot;https://epriego.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/dhdiversity-a-searchable-archive-and-a-quick-comment-from-afar/&quot;&gt;Ernesto Priego&lt;/a&gt;) documents a series of panels and talks identifying ongoing issues of sexism, racism, ableism, and other marginalizations in DH and at our conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are marginalized and in precarious professional roles are still overly called to testify and labor for improvements within DH. And DH is getting big: the yearly DH conference last week drew 902 participants from 45 countries, but diverse representation is lagging behind the realities of who does DH. Projects actively working to make DH better in this regard include &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/roopikarisam&quot;&gt;Roopika Risam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michacardenas&quot;&gt;micha cárdenas&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://criticaldh.roopikarisam.com/&quot;&gt;Social Justice and DH project&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elotroalex&quot;&gt;Alex Gil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryancordell&quot;&gt;Ryan Cordell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arounddh.org/credits/&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arounddh.org/&quot;&gt;Around DH in 80 Days&lt;/a&gt; (which highlights DH centers and projects from around the world); and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/&quot;&gt;Off the Tracks Collaborators’ Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdh.ucla.edu/news-events/a-student-collaborators-bill-of-rights/&quot;&gt;UCLA A Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt; (which both lay out how to ethically credit and celebrate the labor of everyone involved in a DH project).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide27.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I like to work toward what I want my DH to be, I don’t want to give anyone the impression that DH is some utopia. It’s not better than other fields, but it has in its favor some more ways for people to regularly, actively move the field to be a little bit better at a time. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/mydhis&quot;&gt;#MyDHis hashtag&lt;/a&gt; captures people speaking about their visions for what DH should value; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/whatifdh2017&quot;&gt;#WhatIfDH2017&lt;/a&gt; and previous years’ hashtags capture suggestions and provocations challenging the next year’s big DH conference to be better than this year’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to express some of the things that &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; DH is. I tend to see DH as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valuing interdisciplinarity (including of methods)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A celebration and valuing of a variety of skills and professional roles&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As real-time: I love being part of a community where I can ask a question on Twitter or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;DH Slack&lt;/a&gt; and hear a bunch of ideas in the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As valuing sharing what you learn, without needing to be an expert: I was able to get started doing some very basic information visualization work and &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/gephi/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; about what I did. Even without being anything ever near an expert in information visualization, I’ve heard from people who were also able to get started in infoviz by reading my blog posts. (If you’re interested in information visualization and analysis, one place to start is Miriam Posner’s blog (&lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/#network&quot;&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/the-case-of-the-missing-faces/&quot;&gt;infoviz and ethics for historical research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/a-fun-way-to-introduce-dh-students-to-dataviz/&quot;&gt;infoviz lesson plan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/getting-started-with-palladio/&quot;&gt;Palladio tool&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/scott_bot&quot;&gt;Scott Weingart&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/index.html@p=39600.html&quot;&gt;when networks are inappropriate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;On review: wow, there’s a lot of other things #myDHis not in this list, but I think they’re represented by the projects I chose to cite in this talk: public and participatory, diverse and inclusive and anti-racist, ethical and respectful… hoping to update my old “DH values” post soon to better hold myself to perform these values in my work.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide28.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;a very DHy dissertation&lt;/a&gt; that didn’t have any chapter writing; instead, I was able to spend some time thinking through the best methods and publication formats for pursuing my research question and sharing what I learned. It turned out that designing, coding, blogging, and user-testing what I’d built were the best ways for my research to go. Being linked into the DH community was a big part of successfully being able to do that as my dissertation, instead of doing one traditional dissertation, and a whole extra DH project that wasn’t officially counted. The DH I’ve encountered is open to rethinking how what we value as scholars can look, given today’s knowledge and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to see people not feeling enfranchised to call themselves digital humanists, not feeling enfranchised to call themselves scholars, not feeling enfranchised to call all their critical efforts research. So I tend to emphasize these labels to counteract imposter syndrome, people being undercredited, people not getting opportunities to situate their work as intellectual labor.
I also want to recognize that there are negative results of this habit: not everyone is or wants to be called a digital humanist or a scholar or a researcher, so I absolutely do not want to say someone is any of these things, if that’s not how someone identifies themself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide29.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;twitter.com/moyazb&quot;&gt;Moya Bailey&lt;/a&gt; at Northeastern recently gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.culturalfront.org/2016/07/reflections-on-space-place-in.html&quot;&gt;a great talk here&lt;/a&gt; discussing the pros and cons of strategically leveraging the phrase “digital humanities”, and I’d encourage you all to &lt;a href=&quot;http://moyabailey.com/projects/dh/&quot;&gt;check out her work&lt;/a&gt;. She emphasized that choosing to label yourself or your work via DH can open opportunities for funding and publicity and community, but identifying with DH can also close doors or make others expect certain things about your work, or turn away scholars who are not interested in or are resistant to digital scholarship. So maybe what you do, or want to do, or the community you want to join or create, isn’t DH: you can still make use of DH-labeled resources, but choose to identify yourself and your work in a variety of ways, and attend a plethora of DHy conferences beyond the main huge DH event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide30.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage people starting with DH—especially students looking to take on a DH project but also complete their coursework or dissertation—to remember that prototyping is an option. That is, you can have a research question and imagine an ideal digital method or tool or presentation format to pursue that research. To then document the critical thinking that went into your brainstorming design, to list problems you foresee or storyboard how someone might engage with your idea, to get out your colored pencils and sketch your tool, or use some other way of wireframing or prototyping what you’re imagining—and then share all that with your community, is scholarship. It absolutely contributes to communal knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t some magical requirement that you go on and code the idea yourself, though you certainly can embark on learning how to do that—having a specific project in mind does wonders for making tutorials stick in your brain. And learning about cod,e or other pieces of realizing a DH project, helps you understand issues, limitations, opportunities you might not have seen otherwise. Or, understand why DH has treated some opportunities as low-hanging fruit and others as blue-sky wishes. But you can also leave that scholarship to a collaborator—coding and building are useful methods, but they are just some of many methods out there, and nobody needs to take all of them on. Many DH projects are necessarily collaborative, because they require many skills and no one person is likely to offer expertise for each. You can work in DH without needing to do everything yourself, and without being an expert in coding or a digital method; maybe your contribution is historical knowledge, or being great at locating information online, or designing, documenting, user testing, or publicizing, among many other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide31.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samplereality&quot;&gt;Mark Sample&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samplereality.com/2013/02/08/when-does-service-become-scholarship/&quot;&gt;a fantastic blog essay on the question: “When does service become scholarship?”&lt;/a&gt;, in which he says his answer to that question “is simply this: a creative or intellectual act becomes scholarship when it is public and circulates in a community of peers that evaluates and builds upon it.” One of the things I like most about DH, is that practitioners tend to recognize and reward scholarship in its many methods and forms. Scholarship isn’t bounded by what your professional title is or whether you create something that looks like a book or journal article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see DH as not just about openness to many methods as ways to think critically and share those thoughts, but also as a movement to recognize meta-activities such as project management and documentation as scholarship. So my biggest reason why DH can be good for you, for your department or unit or university, is that it usually comes with a culture of valuing all kinds of effort. I do want to recognize that some people don’t want to identify as scholars or their work as scholarly; when I speak of scholars here, I mean everyone who’s interested in doing their best thinking and sharing the results of that thinking with others, whether you’re teaching, developing a library unit workflow, coding, writing, or another method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, it can make a useful difference in how you feel about your job and your work, if you start to value all of your effort as part of being a scholar, or feel enfranchised to identify as a scholar or researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying with DH opens up an interdisciplinary community that, while in &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; perfect, is at least sometimes better than traditional academic departments at a couple useful things—and when it fails, we at least more often have public discussions about that failure, and these at least more often can slowly improve our community (e.g. when the big DH conference had all-female keynote speakers this year, and the #DHdiversity hashtag was used extensively to identify ongoing problems and suggest improvements). DH tends to welcome newcomers a little more, in part because it’s the norm for someone with years of experience in some academic field to be new to a digital method, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DH tends to value all kinds of professional roles and to think about how to make collaboration and attribution and credit work well, because the skills we need to make solid projects incorporate all kinds of design, theoretical, practical, technical, archival thinking (and when I say theoretical, I guess I should point out that a big thing in DH is recognizing that it isn’t just article and book writing that gets to be called “theory”; that all methods of research, for example coding and digital platform design, engage in existing theory and develop their own theories as well). Being part of this community means you can use platforms like Twitter and Slack to get real-time feedback on your thinking and projects, and sometimes you’re able to focus on and reach much wider audiences than traditional scholarship allows. (Twitter isn’t any safer for being a DHer, but on the DH Slack I’m trying to hold discussions to a code of conduct as far as a couple casual moderators can for 700 people.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHers use the term “alt-ac” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23altac&quot;&gt;#altac&lt;/a&gt;) to refer to “alternative academic” positions, which are career paths that satisfy your desire to work as a scholar while recognizing that tenure-track teaching positions are extremely limited in number, and that many excellent researchers who would like to have such a position just can’t, in terms of position availability. There’s some really good blogging about DHer alt-ac experiences, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/&quot;&gt;the #alt-academy mediacommons project&lt;/a&gt;. It might not seem like a big deal to be aware of related types of job if you’re coming from interdisciplinary library science, but often humanities PhDs come out of their dissertations without being aware of career options other than tenure-track teaching. Besides the obvious digital skills involvement in DH can help you develop, related abilities like being able to work well with a team of people with different interests and backgrounds, and having experience in project design, management, and grant-writing, are all skills DH projects can model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the university level, DH’s emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, methodologies over content, and recognition that all academic fields deal with history of the field, ethics, subjective interpretation, design, and texts will help us connect libraries and liberal arts units to other campus communities including STEM departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide34.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll finish up with some resources for getting started in DH. I’ll talk briefly about where to ask questions and find foundational resources online, where to publish and read current DH work, doing DH as a job, and arguing about DH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide35.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a combination of things you can do to get involved in DH, either where you are (depending on local resources) or online. Does your library have a DH, digital scholarship, or other “digital something” librarian or unit—someone who doesn’t also happen to be you? If not, I’d still recommend asking around if your colleagues have consulted or collaborated with anyone on campus doing DH. Student and staff working groups and book clubs are another option—if there aren’t any where you are, you might use a campus listserv and put out a call for anyone interested in meeting to chat and work through reading a solid DH resource such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/&quot;&gt;Debates in the Digital Humanities series&lt;/a&gt; (which is free online, and offers timely argumentative pieces about the shape and future of DH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen some people come at DH by taking a term they keep hearing—say, Drupal websites—and deciding to learn that thing. Having that focus can work well, but I find you’re more likely to be successful if you get a little help at the start in choosing a tool or method that’s actually the best fit for your interests (Drupal, for example, can do cool things but is a headache to maintain, so you only want to use it when you need features other options don’t offer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can find someone in-person or online who’s involved in DH, ask if they’d be willing to point you in the right direction given your interests, whether that’s a specific research question or imagined project, or just the desire to learn how digital methods could support your love of Victorian dime novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to ask strangers online for help, and I know people involved in scholarly organizations who are thinking through making virtual mentoring a good option. In the meantime, safer places to ask for direction or advice include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/&quot;&gt;DH Q&amp;amp;A forum&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHSlack&quot;&gt;DH Slack&lt;/a&gt; (which is like a set of DH themed chatrooms, with currently over 700 members and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/DHslack/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md&quot;&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;DH Slack&lt;/a&gt; has a number of channels (or themed chatrooms) for asking any level of DH question, for students wanting to discuss fitting DH into their studies, for self-identified beginners, and for people interested in seeing the kinds of jobs and conferences currently available in DH. I run the Slack, so if you’re curious about joining or participating, but have questions or would like suggestions for getting involved, please feel free to tweet at me (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot;&gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt;) or send me an email (viscount@purdue.edu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide36.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a project idea that needs funding, DH funders including &lt;a href=&quot;https://mellon.org/grants/&quot;&gt;Mellon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neh.gov/&quot;&gt;NEH&lt;/a&gt; (National Endowment for the Humanities and especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh&quot;&gt;the NEH Office of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imls.gov/&quot;&gt;IMLS&lt;/a&gt; (Institute of Museum and Library Services) often post example grant proposals or successful past proposals, which can be useful in shaping your research or discovering precedents in a subfield, even if you’re not applying for a grant yourself. If you are interested in grant funding, though, you should know that some regular DH funders—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh&quot;&gt;the NEH Office of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt; definitely, and I believe also the IMLS?—have amazing program officers willing to read through and comment on your grant proposal, if you ask for feedback before the actual grant submission deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide37.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the good places to read about and publish in DH &lt;em&gt;(note: resources linked in this section are very much non-exhaustive as there are lots more places to read/share/do DH, but this blog represents a time-limited talk rather than an exhaustive resource—see &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/mswEpAIS9K&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for more stuff!):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/&quot;&gt;DH Now&lt;/a&gt; is an aggregator of DH online content; I use it to hear about new blog posts on DH topics, but it also aggregates DH events, CFPs, and job openings. You can follow via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhnow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or RSS feed. But DH now isn’t just a good way to hear about DH, it’s a good place to get started in DH social media. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/editors-corner/volunteer/&quot;&gt;volunteer as an editor of DH Now&lt;/a&gt;, which means that during a specific week you’ll curate a feed of incoming content from &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/subscribed-feeds/&quot;&gt;a huge set of DH blogs and websites&lt;/a&gt;, and recommend the best stuff for sharing. This is a great way to get an overview of who you might want to follow on Twitter or who’s doing work related to your interests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another option is &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/&quot;&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt; website (&lt;em&gt;I should note that I’ve just joined the site’s editorial team last week because I like the project so much—so I’m biased, but for a good reason&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt; offers peer-reviewed, novice-friendly lessons on DH tools and methods; it’s not only pitched at the right place for someone who wants to learn a skill but doesn’t already know other digital methods; each lesson tries to explain why a humanities researcher might want to use the tool, and how. In addition to being a good place for learning, it’s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/contribute&quot;&gt;a place to do peer-reviewed publication of DH lessons and tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. If you need peer-reviewed pieces for promotion or tenure in your job, this can be a way to get credit for skills you already know, while at the same time mentoring others you want to learn those skills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcommons.org/&quot;&gt;DH Commons&lt;/a&gt; is both a platform for sharing DH projects and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcommons.org/collaborators&quot;&gt;volunteering as a collaborator&lt;/a&gt; for things like beta-testing new DH work, and also &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcommons.org/journal&quot;&gt;an online, peer-reviewed journal&lt;/a&gt;. This journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcommons.org/journal/submission-guidelines&quot;&gt;supports submitting peer-reviewed publications&lt;/a&gt; of two DHy types: you can submit DH project statements (explanations of the work that went into your DH research) and you can submit  “How did they make that?” pieces (explaining the tech/design/methods that went into making what you made, based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miriamkp&quot;&gt;Miriam Posner&lt;/a&gt;’s highly recommended &lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/&quot;&gt;blog post of the same title&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other journals friendly to DH publication (and free to read online!) include:
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Quarterly&lt;/a&gt; 
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies&quot;&gt;Digital Studies&lt;/a&gt; 
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/&quot;&gt;The Journal of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt; (on hiatus, but past articles are interesting to read)
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://vectorsjournal.org/&quot;&gt;Vectors&lt;/a&gt;, a journal for publishing multimedia work in DH and related areas. I believe they take all kinds of DH pieces (websites, visualizations, etc.) but may have a preference for things authored using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/&quot;&gt;Scalar&lt;/a&gt; tool?
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/resources/digital-humanities-journals&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities at Berkeley’s great overview of these and other DH publications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide38.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not interested in a DH job yourself, keeping abreast of recent DH job ads can give you a better sense of how different DH subfields and tools cluster—you’ll see what kinds of tools DH archivists are using, what history professors are using, and be better able to point others in the right direction for getting involved in DH. And if you are thinking about a DH career, being aware of the language in DH job ads can help you tailor your learning toward a specific role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Miriam Posner &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/MiriamPosnerJobs&quot;&gt;posts DHy jobs to her Pinboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/category/news/job/&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Now’s job feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using general job search engines like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usajobs.gov&quot;&gt;USA Jobs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Digital-humanities&quot;&gt;Indeed.com with “digital humanities” as the search term&lt;/a&gt; is more hit and miss, but you can set things up so they email you whenever a job matching DH appears on their sites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re interested in government DHy jobs (e.g. NEH ODH, IMLS, Smithsonian…), besides searching by institution on the USA Jobs site, you can follow NEH ODH Senior Program Officer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jenserventi&quot;&gt;Jennifer Serventi&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, where she periodically shares these humanities-focused jobs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JenServenti/status/755926991388315648&quot;&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other places to scope DH and related digital library jobs include:
* &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.h-net.org/jobs/job_search.php?category_id=29&quot;&gt;H-Net DH jobs&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://jobs.code4lib.org/jobs/digital-humanities/&quot;&gt;Code 4 Lib DH jobs&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hastac.org/events-opportunities/jobs-and-fellowships&quot;&gt;HASTAC jobs and fellowships&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diglib.org/contact/jobs/&quot;&gt;Digital Library Federation job postings&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://acrl.ala.org/dh/&quot;&gt;DH+Lib website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/dh+lib&quot;&gt;@DH+lib Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start to see a lot of projects that fit your interest coming from one DH center or department, it can’t hurt to follow their website’s RSS feed to hear about new job openings. And when you apply, remember that DH gives you particular skills beyond technical ones, and you should demonstrate these skills to potential employers: the ability to handle project management (even more, often for projects with less precedents than usual precedents in academia!), experience with collaboration and interdisciplinarity, and learning to communicate in voices suited to multiple audiences and with relevancy for who you’re talking to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide39.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I wanted to say a bit about arguing to do DH. If you run into trouble with someone preventing you from doing DH work (e.g. saying you can’t use your professional development funding to learn a DH tool, or that you can’t satisfy coursework with digital scholarship), you can help you argument in a couple ways. You might develop a concise statement or elevator pitch, using no specialist/technical language: maybe one paragraph on what your final deliverables will look like (to help people picture what you’ll do), and one paragraph explaining why your digital methods or format are the best way for exploring and communicating your research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also help to assemble a list of precedents for your work. When I was arguing that I should be able to design and code a digital edition for my dissertation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2013/08/19/scholarlyexperimentation&quot;&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2013/06/26/experimental-editions&quot;&gt;pointed to&lt;/a&gt; work by established scholars like Alan Galey, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/index.html&quot;&gt;Visualizing Variation&lt;/a&gt; project uses code to make arguments about early modern textual scholarship. I also looked for examples both of similar methods and formats; in my case, my committee pointed out that literature departments have a history of allowing a print scholarly edition as a dissertation. I also looked to pre-digital precedents in my subfield: textual scholarship—the people who create scholarly editions of texts—has a long history of using design and building to perform arguments (e.g. the Victorian editor Teena Rochfort Smith created &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2013/06/26/experimental-editions&quot;&gt;an experimental prototype of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with typography so innovative it would have been impossible to print at scale at that time). A lot of the rejection of digital scholarship hinges on it being “different” from non-digital scholarship, so showing the ways digital scholarship is a natural successor to research widely recognized as scholarship is a useful tactic (not “digital vs. traditional”, but “digital vs. non-digital”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I hope I communicated earlier, DH is not perfect. DH has a lot of areas where we can greatly improve as a community. That said, I don’t want to overemphasize the issue of needing to argue for DH as scholarship. Instead of predicting that my DH work will meet with resistance, I try to design my work to invite understanding, by doing things like showing its continuity with past non-digital work, and making sure I’m careful about defining technical terms. From just my particular point of view, I can say that presenting DH pedagogically rather than defensively has been great at helping me communicate with people not involved in DH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you to organizers Jason Clark, Oliver Bendorf, and Sara Mannheimer, as well as to the DLF eResearch Network members for being a great audience! Also, a big thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elikaortega&quot;&gt;Élika Ortega&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StewartVarner&quot;&gt;Stewart Varner&lt;/a&gt; (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://stewartvarner.com/2016/01/what-dh-could-be/&quot;&gt;What DH Could Be&lt;/a&gt;”) for changing how I present on and define DH. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/arc.html?key=1zlUFubccXY7Pekfs0bXgxzIbNalJPGvU_SJIlmLTI50&amp;amp;gid=400689247&quot;&gt;#DHdiversity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/mydhis&quot;&gt;#MyDHis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/whatifdh2017&quot;&gt;#WhatIfDH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://transformdh.org/&quot;&gt;#TransformDH&lt;/a&gt; DHers are also awesome and have helped me be a better DHer and person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. I can’t find the original creator of the GIF on my first slide (museum gallery with framed loading icons). Let me know if you know—I’d like to credit them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/2016/07/15/digital-humanities-update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lots of DH stuff cooking lately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; project was mentioned and linked in the &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;! The piece, by J.D. Biersdorfer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/books/review/cant-get-through-ulysses-digital-help-is-on-the-way.html&quot;&gt;appeared online July 13, 2016 as “Can’t Get Through ‘Ulysses’? Digital Help Is on the Way”&lt;/a&gt; and in print on Sunday, July 17, 2016 in the “Sunday Book Review” section of the paper under the headline “Virtual Odyssey”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; editorial team as an editor and also ombudsperson. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an online, peer-reviewed, novice-friendly platform for humanities scholars wishing to learn digital methods and tools. (You might remember I published a lesson, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;”, with &lt;em&gt;PH&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be presenting to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diglib.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Library Federation&lt;/a&gt; (DLF) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diglib.org/groups/e-research-network/&quot;&gt;eResearch Network&lt;/a&gt; as their DH speaker in a six-talk series on digital library research and data management practice, on July 20th. I’ll cover what digital humanities is, why it can be good for you and your institution, and how to get started in DH. The slides and talk video should go online shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH 2016 conference just finished up (check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/arc.html?key=1zlUFubccXY7Pekfs0bXgxzIbNalJPGvU_SJIlmLTI50&amp;amp;gid=400689247&quot;&gt;the #DHdiversity tweets&lt;/a&gt; especially), so incoming new ACH executive officers Scott Weingart, Micki Kaufman, and I have begun our 2016-2020 terms, along with Jen Guiliano as the new ACH president 2016-2018 and Matt Gold as the new vice-president 2016-2018 and 2018-2020.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How the Digital Humanities uses Slack to support and build a geographically dispersed intellectual community</title>
   <link href="/2016/07/13/digital-humanities-slack-london-school-economics"/>
   <updated>2016-07-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/07/13/digital-humanities-slack-london-school-economics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was invited to write a piece on the Digital Humanities Slack for the London School of Economics blog (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/07/13/using-slack-to-support-a-geographically-dispersed-community/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), and I’m crossposting it here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a member of the digital humanities (DH) community—we’re builders, tech users, teachers, and thinkers around digital tools exploring literature, history, and other cultural heritage fields (stuff like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/uncategorized/preserving-reconstructing-teaching-in-3d/&quot;&gt;3D printing for archaeology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://viraltexts.org/&quot;&gt;text analysis of historical memes in newspapers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;interfaces that let readers interpret and discuss challenging novels&lt;/a&gt;). One of the more recent ways we communicate is via a Digital Humanities Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is a digital platform (web or desktop/mobile app) much like a set of chatrooms for a team of people: you can chat in real-time, and create ongoing “channels” (chatrooms) around specific themes or topics (&lt;a href=&quot;https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users&quot;&gt;here’s a good overview of what Slack is/how to use it&lt;/a&gt;). Slack is a bit different from chatting you might have done in the past, in that it’s set up to integrate with a variety of web services that help in project management, website monitoring, social media, and other needs of business teams. Because Slack is built with limited teams from inside one business in mind, we needed to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dherbst/slack-invite-script&quot;&gt;Darrel Herbst’s Slack invite script&lt;/a&gt; to instead allow anyone to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Digital Humanities Slack is open to anyone with a curiosity about DH and/or related interests (e.g. digital libraries, museums, and archives)—those interested just visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;tinyurl.com/DHslack&lt;/a&gt; to join. Absolutely no DH expertise is required, and we have several specific channels devoted to DH beginners, students, job seekers, and asking all kinds of DHy questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH Slack was created in October 2015 after a suggestion from Ed Summers, and was built by the channel creation and chatting of its members. Nine months later (as of July 6, 2016), we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;700 members (84% of which have used the Slack over the past two weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;67 “channels” (chat rooms devoted to specific topics)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;21.3k messages sent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About 60% of messages are on public channels, with the other 40% being DMs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;180 files (shared code, documents, screenshots…) have been shared and stored on the Slack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loading screen messages that quote definitions of DH from a variety of practitioners (thanks to Matthew Lincoln), and when someone types “what is the digital humanities”, a bot responds by pointing you to the 800+ definitions for DH over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com&quot;&gt;whatisdigitalhumanities.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Channels (chat rooms) are user-created, and the names of channels are represented with a pound sign and no spaces (#DHteaching). The current channels cover&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;socializing and academic community information (e.g. #hottopic for chatting about current DH issues like the latest LARB interview, and channels to share upcoming conferences and job opportunities)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regions and languages (e.g. a Spanish-language channel, channels for DHers in Baltimore, the Bay Area, and Tennessee)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;academic fields (e.g. people working in libraries, museums, publishing, and environmental humanities)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;getting started in the digital humanities (e.g. a place to ask for tutorials to learn specific skills, a channel for talking about what being a DH student is like)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;specific DH methods and practices (e.g. visualization, linked open data, coding, crowdsourcing, machine learning, teaching DH)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;plus a #meta channel to discuss the DH Slack community itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is a comparatively new platform for DHers, who have been blogging and using Facebook and Twitter as part of their intellectual life almost since those platforms began. For example, I use Twitter to share blog posts on my in-progress work and teaching; hear about others’ blog posts, projects, and publications; discover potential project collaborators and mentors (including people who don’t work in academia); and as a backchannel to share and discuss conference presentations in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still figuring out how Slack can be useful: Can it allow different kinds of conversations than Twitter? Can we use it to teach and support people interested in DH who don’t have mentors geographically near them, or who aren’t inside academia? Like Twitter, Slack allows coexisting formal use (posting job opportunities, discussing theories) with informal socializing (which is really part of professional work, since it lays good foundations for future collaboration and problem-solving). Interesting uses of the DH Slack I’ve seen so far include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A user creating a channel around their specific research interests, and chatting in that channel as a sort of live-blog of the different approaches they’re trying and how they address issues as they arise (other Slack members can read or ask questions in the channel, too)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If an interesting discussion on Twitter starts to feel stifled or miscommunicated because of Twitter’s size constraints, moving the conversation to the DH Slack allows more freedom while also keeping the conversation semi-public (it’s more public than moving to an email conversation, but anyone wanting to follow the conversation does need to join the DH Slack first)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mentoring and socializing: I’ve seen Slack members walk each other through fixing a coding bug or suggest lesson plans, and we use the #weeklies channel for weekly sharing around a fun theme (e.g. what’s a book that changed your way of thinking?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A user sharing a digital humanities method tutorial, then offering to be available on the DH Slack for a certain evening to answer any questions about the tutorial (with the idea that people are encouraged to try working through the tutorial, knowing they will have help if they get stuck or have a question)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve collectively discussed the design of our community, deciding by lazy consensus issues like whether we should keep a permanent archive of all messages sent on the Slack, or keep things ephemeral (check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/07/06/digital-humanities-slack-community-design&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion and more examples of that collective community design). &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/DHslack/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md&quot;&gt;Our evolving code of conduct lives here&lt;/a&gt;, and Slack members are encouraged to suggest additions or changes via #meta. We’re dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, with a particular reminder that dismissing or belittling lack of DH, tech, or other experience (e.g. answering questions with links to Let Me Google That For You) is not allowed. This code helps us set expectations for behavior and promote the Slack as a safe and welcoming space for everyone. With the code and open community design discussion in place, we’re finding that Slack works pretty well at supporting a broad, geographically dispersed intellectual community!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Digital Humanities Slack & Community Design</title>
   <link href="/2016/07/06/digital-humanities-slack-community-design"/>
   <updated>2016-07-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/07/06/digital-humanities-slack-community-design</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 7/7/2016: The “message archive” section has been updated to reflect a Slack feature pointed out by Jeff Godin—thanks, Jeff!.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come join the Digital Humanities Slack, a set of DHy chatrooms! (Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;tinyurl.com/DHslack&lt;/a&gt; to join.) &lt;strong&gt;We are open to anyone&lt;/strong&gt; with a curiosity about DH and/or related interests (e.g. digital libraries, museums, and archives). Absolutely no expertise needed, and we have several specific chat rooms (called “channels” on Slack) devoted to DH beginners, students, job seekers, and asking all kinds of DHy and digital methods questions. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users&quot;&gt;Here’s a good overview of what Slack is/how to use it&lt;/a&gt;. I’m happy to answer questions about how to use Slack or what it is via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dh-slack-stats&quot;&gt;DH Slack stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH Slack was created in October 2015 after a suggestion from Ed Summers, and was built by the channel creation and chatting of its members. Nine months later (as of July 6, 2016), we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;700 members (84% of which have used the Slack over the past two weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;67 “channels” (chat rooms devoted to specific topics)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;21.3k messages sent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About 60% of messages are on public channels, with the other 40% being DMs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;180 files (shared code, documents, screenshots…) have been shared and stored on the Slack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matthew Lincoln set up Slack loading screen messages to quote definitions of DH from a variety of practitioners! And when someone types “what is the digital humanities”, a bot should respond by pointing you to the 800+ definitions over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com&quot;&gt;whatisdigitalhumanities.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Channels (chat rooms) are Slack user-created, and the names of channels are represented with a pound sign and no space (#wordlefans). The current channels include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socializing and community info:&lt;/strong&gt; #introductions (share a little about your DH interests and what you do, or let people know about a new channel you created), #conferences, #off-topic (water cooler space for non-DHy chat and GIFs), #jobs, #announcements (events, CFPs, new projects), #hottopic (chat about current general DH issues, like that LARB piece…), #reading (share recent DH and entertainment reading and discuss books), #weeklies (weekly fun themes/survey questions)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional and language channels:&lt;/strong&gt; #dh-california, #dh_humanidadesdigital, #dh-tennessee, #dh-bay-area, #dh-baltimore&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fields:&lt;/strong&gt; #libraries, #dh-archives, #museums, #publichistory, #arthistory, #envirohumanities, #mediastudies, #elit, #publishing, #openaccess, #copyright&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting started:&lt;/strong&gt; #DHanswers (both pulls from the DH Q&amp;amp;A site, and a space for asking new questions), #students (talk about the experience of being a student, doing DH as a student…), #beginners (welcoming space for those just getting started in DH), #tutorialplease (ask for pointers to good tutorials on something you want to learn) and #tutorials (share useful tutorials as you run across them)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific DH methods and practices:&lt;/strong&gt; #methodology, #visualization, #data-sharing, #annotation (plus a channel specifically about #hypothes-is annotation), #geospatial, #networks, #coding, #design, #linkeddata, #bots, #crowdsourcing, #gaming, #linux, #machinelearning, #databases, #physcomp, #topicmodel, #bibliography, #textencoding, #texthacking, #textanalysis, #datacuration, #philosophy, #simulation, #music, #sound, #3dscholarship, #codesnippets&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching/learning:&lt;/strong&gt; #teachingDH, #digitalpedagogy, #programminghistorian (for discussions around the DH tutorial website)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And #meta&lt;/strong&gt; (to discuss the DH Slack itself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-design-decisions&quot;&gt;Community design decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is a comparatively new platform (vs. Twitter), so DHers are still figuring out how it can be useful and how to best run the DH Slack. Anyone can join the DH Slack (&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;tinyurl.com/DHslack&lt;/a&gt;) and then visit the #meta channel to participate in decisions about our community design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who shared thoughts on improving the DH Slack on the Slack, via email, or on Twitter, including DH Slack members Sam Abrams, Kristen Mapes, Matthew Lincoln, Ed Summers, Alan G. Pike, Liz Lorang, Hyperverses, timfinnegan, Jeremy Throne, Brandon Locke, Lincoln Mullen, Brian Croxall, Jeff Godin, and Micah Vandegrift, and others via Twitter and email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;After community discussion, we’re keeping the DH Slack as ephemeral (no longterm archive of all messages) and not allowing people who aren’t signed into the Slack to read it. I’d be happy to chat with and amplify the platform of anyone who wants to make a DH Slack alternative that does either/both of these things, and I agree that it would be nice to have a place where Twitter conversations could be comfortably and publicly expanded (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://Hypothes.is&quot;&gt;Hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; annotation?)—it’s just that the place to do that right now isn’t the DH Slack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the issues we’ve been thinking through. I’ve heard reasonable arguments for public readability and/or archiving from people who haven’t been using the Slack. Hearing from non-Slacker users is good, since we want to be careful about decisions that deter others from joining; on the other hand, submitting feedback after using this Slack shows both an understanding of how people have been using it, and buy-in to the outcome of these decisions. (That’s what my thinking has been in weighing input from inside and outside the Slack.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code of conduct&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/DHslack/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md&quot;&gt;Our evolving code of conduct lives here&lt;/a&gt;, and Slack members are encouraged to suggest additions or changes via #meta. To summarize, we’re dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, with a particular reminder that dismissing or belittling lack of DH, tech, or other experience (e.g. answering questions with links to Let Me Google That For You) is not allowed. We provide a list with specific examples of what constitutes harassment and a statement on handling of “reverse-isms”. &lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; we’re also looking at a statement on how to approach using screenshots or exports of the Slack for research use or for discussion outside the Slack (see “Message archive” update below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public reading.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to Sava Saheli for pointing out that the problem with moving unwieldy Twitter conversations to the DH Slack is that this adds a barrier to public reading not present on Twitter (anyone can sign up for the DH Slack and start using it right away, but you do need to sign up and know how to navigate Slack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Slack and the self-hosted OS Slack alternative Mattermost (that I’ll discuss below) don’t allow non-signed-in (public) reading. Our workaround would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdlincoln/jekyll-slack&quot;&gt;Matthew Lincoln’s nice solution for exporting Slack messages to a GitHub Pages-hosted Jekyll website&lt;/a&gt;. This would require someone to remember to periodically manually export the Slack’s messages and upload them to GitHub, and I’m not sure if our 10k message limit would cause a problem (each export would be missing earlier messages, so new exports to GitHub might overwrite old ones, meaning older messages would disappear from the public site–insofar as anything disappears from the web given Internet Archive, screenshots, etc.). One option would be to only export certain channels that are visibly marked as public-readable, rather than exporting the entire DH Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed whether allowing public reading this way would make people more or less comfortable using the DH Slack, reaching out both on the DH Slack to active users, and on Twitter to inactive users and people who haven’t joined the DH Slack. I heard more people as neutral or against making any of the DH Slack publicly readable this way, making me think we shouldn’t pursue it for now. A twice-cited reason was that a code of conduct is useful when applied not just to people writing on the Slack, but to people reading it as well; if only signed-in people can read the DH Slack, then we can block anyone who harasses from continuing to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Message archive.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re at 21.3k Slack messages, and Slack limits its free plan users to seeing the most recent 10k messages. We discussed whether we should pursue a plan that gives us access to the full archive of messages (or come up with a hack to preserve these on our own, like Matthew Lincoln’s solution discussed above). I heard more people who were neutral or against doing this, so we won’t do it. One cited reason was that ephemerality was freeing: people tend to use the Slack as a place for informal chat, memes, and gifs as well as scholarship, and knowing you’re on the record for whatever you say has a chilling effect on that use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 7/7/2016:&lt;/em&gt; Jeff Godin pointed out that on our free Slack plan, although no one can access messages older than the most recent 10k via the Slack or admin dashboard, people with admin privileges &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; export the Slack as a JSON file and that file will include all messages since the beginning of the Slack (does not include private group history or files, direct message history or files, edit and deletion logs). The JSON isn’t super-friendly to read, but I’ll bet a good number of DHers are familiar with transforming it into something easily human-readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already knew that we can’t have a truly ephemeral space because of screenshots, etc., but anyone who has changed feelings because of this discovery is invited to share them. Also, I started a conversation on #meta about how this knowledge might be reflected in our code of conduct. I’m leaning toward: if you’re going to share a snapshot of a conversation on the Slack, you must ask anyone whose username is shown first and receive permission from them (including honoring if they only give permission if you black out their username). For research/public discussion use of the Slack message export, you should ask in the #meta channel and wait to get an explicit okay from an admin who has had time to synthesize responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack alternative?&lt;/strong&gt; Micki Kaufman suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost&quot;&gt;Mattermost&lt;/a&gt; as a Slack alternative: Mattermost is open-source, not run by a for-profit company, self-hosted, and has a tool to import users from Slack. I think this is a really promising platform, and if we were back in October I’d probably have tried it first before Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a couple reasons, we’re not moving the DH Slack to Mattermost—but anyone is welcomed to set up their own Mattermost install on their servers and create a DH community. I’d happily advertise such as platform on the DH Slack! One reason we’re not moving right now is buy-in: people already use Slack for other teams (work, participating in project discussions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wk0JdF2Cty2VHMqpf_QlJXVKQdUtfeeFhaYRben3qaM/viewform&quot;&gt;Documenting the Now’s awesome chatroom around social media archiving ethics&lt;/a&gt;) and can move between those and the DH Slack in the same app, instead of having an additional platform open. We’re at 700 members, so although the Mattermost user import tool sounds very useful, we’d need to secure permission and interest from our users to move to that platform, and when this possibility was raised, no one was interested in moving. Someone would also need to provide the web hosting and be willing to maintain and upgrade the installation longterm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DH scholarly organization oversight?&lt;/strong&gt; We originally approached a DH scholarly organization about sponsoring the DH Slack because doing so would let us use Slack’s free non-profit plan, which gives you access to a permanent archive of all your Slack’s messages (the free Slack plan we’re using now only gives you access to the last 10k messages, although it doesn’t delete the hidden messages—you can get access back by upgrading your plan). Just paying for a Slack plan (even with the education discount) is cost-prohibitive as cost is calculated by number of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided to no longer seek sponsorship for the Slack non-profit plan, but we’re still discussing other ways the DH scholarly organization might sponsor or collaborate with the DH Slack. The way Slack forces one person with super admin privileges to “own” a Slack team is weird and undemocratic in our case, when this Slack exists and thrives because of all its members. I think it would still be worth considering a DH scholarly organization being involved just to help with moderation, and to prevent my using my admin privileges to replace all messages with Hamilton memes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hamiltonisawesome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Facebook post: &amp;quot;Washington: we are outgunned! outmanned! Hamilton: I have 3 friends if that helps&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, though, it isn’t good for one person to control something with so many members (even assuming my good intentions and trying to mitigate personal biases, I could e.g. be hit by a bus). DH scholarly organization involvement could just mean the organization would let members know about the Slack, but another option could be having a couple people from the organization (possibly from its communications committee) who would explicitly commit to helping with moderation/code of conduct issues if they arise. We might even switch the Slack “owner” to an account that several explicit moderators could use, instead of it just being my personal account, so the community can continue without resting on a single person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribute:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been trying to synthesize the discussions around these issues, and it’s very possible we’re missing some issues or that my biases are making me interpret people’s responses wrong. Please feel free to tell me so via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;—your name won’t be shared with anyone unless you want it to be. Or if you disagree or think of more reasons why we should reconsider these choices, please let me know! Finally, this isn’t a binding decision—we can definitely revisit these questions at any time in the future as issues arise or the Slack evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Digital Humanities Dissertation Defense Talk</title>
   <link href="/2016/06/20/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk"/>
   <updated>2016-06-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/06/20/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/2016/06/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk/&quot;&gt;DH Now Editors’ Choice post&lt;/a&gt;! (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dh-now/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for more Literature Geek posts highlighted by DH Now.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/14/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-advice&quot;&gt;made a few comments about the dissertation defense process in a previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, and here I’ll blog the actual defense talk. I’m even resisting the urge to edit and improve (although I’ve learned a lot about slide design and public speaking in the past year…). So, this post is a good representation of the actual defense talk I gave on April 14, 2015. If you’ve seen me present on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; in the past year, some pieces of this may be familiar…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I didn’t go back into the talk text and insert full citations, but anything I mention can be found in the bibliography of my dissertation whitepaper at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;dr.amandavisconti.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;Dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; is also the &lt;strong&gt;actual dissertation&lt;/strong&gt;, if you’d like to learn more about the full project (it is not the website for the dissertation—it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the dissertation!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you didn’t see &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/14/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-advice&quot;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt;: I recently realized that although &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;I thoroughly blogged my dissertation (almost 40 blog posts)&lt;/a&gt; and wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2015/05/09/dissertationdefended&quot;&gt;a post after successfully defending the dissertation in April 2015&lt;/a&gt;, I never blogged my actual defense talk. In keeping with &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;blogging the job talk&lt;/a&gt; that took me into my current job, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/grad-advice/&quot;&gt;other DH/grad student advice&lt;/a&gt;, I am now rectifying this oversight!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dh-defense-talk&quot;&gt;The DH defense talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my slides early so that this slide was on the screen before the defense began; when I give invited talks or conference presentations, I make a credits list my last slide instead, so it can stay up during Q&amp;amp;A (I also thank a few key supporters by name: my site users and testers, my dissertation advisor and committee, Michael Widner, and MITH/UMD). Note that any stats about Infinite Ulysses site use were from before the site had surprising publicity via Hacker News (the morning after my defense, so I include those stats in the first month of open beta stats).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.001.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the title slide! (That’s the full title of my dissertation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.002.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/amandavisconti/items/itemKey/4F5DJ2GB/q/taylor&quot;&gt;very favorite works on textual scholarship&lt;/a&gt;, scholarly editor Gary Taylor asks, “How can you love a work, if you don’t know it? How can you know it, if you can’t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” Scholarly editors are integral to the continuum that keeps the stories of the past available to and understood by the present—but in Taylor’s formulation, the “you” is just as important: that public of readers beyond the academy, whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant. What if we build a digital edition and invite everyone to participate in its use? My dissertation considered this question by creating and testing the Infinite Ulysses digital edition with both readers from inside and outside the academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.003.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In studying what follows from a participatory digital edition, I’ve grouped my research into three groups of inquiry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, questions about making the humanities more public and more participatory (that is, welcoming public participation, in addition to making resources theoretically publicly available). How can we design digital editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation in the scholarly love of a text?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My second set of questions focused on the design of digital editions, using Bethany Nowviskie’s idea of edition “interfacing” to do critical textual scholarship work through design, that is different from textual editing tasks. If we design editions for the public, how do we design to handle an influx of readers and annotations on texts (questions of moderation, curation, and personalization)? And what might we learn about digital editions and their texts from the accompanying influx of site use data?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My third set of questions stem from looking at Infinite Ulysses and asking, “is this an edition?” I considered whether we could separate the values of textual scholarship, from the common embodiments of these values. How might this clarification help us imagine new types of digital edition?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My presentation today will start by describing my project’s methods and format, offer some textual scholarship and digital humanities precedents for critical design and code work, and provide a brief tour of the Infinite Ulysses digital edition. I’ll also provide an overview of this project’s interventions and next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.004.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Textual scholar Morris Eaves conceives of editions not just as vessels for textual content, but also as “problem-solving mechanisms”. The problem of designing participatory digital editions was best addressed by designing, building, and testing real use of a digital edition. Analytical discussion took the form of research blogging throughout the course of the project, averaging out to about one post a month for the last three years. Analytical discussion of the project was also performed through a whitepaper authored near the end of the project; where the prospectus was a briefing for the project, with a lit review and justification of the project’s exigence, the whitepaper served as a debriefing, a place to consider what was learned and what my next research steps should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.005.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In textual scholarship, there’s a history of embodying arguments both about specific texts, and about how edition interfaces function. Editing has always intertwined theory and embodied practice. Arguments about which document (or patchwork of documents) best represents the ideal of a text, for example, were practically realized through editions of specific texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see an example of textual arguments being made through textual interfaces up on the screen. On the left is a page from the print variorum edition of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species. Between the first and sixth editions, the word count went up by 40,000 words. This is an edition that values giving the reader access, to the full picture of the text in all its variations. It is unpleasant to read, but it’s not really intended to be read, but for researchers to focus on changes to a specific section of the text (searching rather than browsing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the right, is a static screenshot of Ben Fry’s animated visualization of these changes in the text over time. If you visit his site, you can see the visualization shift, as new words are added or taken away from different sections over time, and you can also zoom in and read the text at any stage of its development. This is a textual interface that values awareness of the changing shape of the whole text over time (browsing rather than searching).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.006.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design experiments aren’t a new tactic in textual scholarship. The typographic and spatial innovations of scholarly editor Teena Rochfort Smith’s 1883 &lt;em&gt;Four-Text ‘Hamlet’ in Parallel Columns&lt;/em&gt; offer one example of experimentation, that focused on editions as a form. Smith intended this prototype to provide several transcriptions of Hamlet’s quartos, as well as her own edition of the play, side-by-side. The edition employed six varieties of typeface, four inks, three kinds of underlining, and daggers, asterisks, and other symbols to call out the presence and extent of variance. Like the Darwin print variorum, this edition values giving the reader access to a fuller picture of the text in all its variations, but this edition also values its user being able to access each work fully—something made possible by the parallel columns and notation, instead of a single column of inline variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prototype would have been nearly impossible to typeset and print in 1883. Smith worked toward a simpler final version of the edition after circulating this prototype. This suggests Smith’s initial focus was on an experiment with the form of a prototyped edition, rather than a fully realized edition with a focus on its text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.007.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent example of text-specific critical design is seen in Jeffrey Masten’s edition &lt;em&gt;A/The Old Law&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left we have a page from the EEBO scan of the early modern Middleton Rowley play, and on the right we have one of the pages as edited by Masten. He argues that for texts like this one, multiple readings of single words were the historical reality, due to puns, bad printing, and non-standardized spelling. Masten views this play as very much about multiple possible interpretations of laws legal, moral, and Biblical. He reflects this emphasis in print design by arbitrarily flipping between the use of side and footnotes, throughout the pages of his edition. Because he also includes his textual commentary in these notes, this randomizing makes it difficult for the reader to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; read the “real” text of the play, or to ignore reading about these possible variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.008.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m most interested in experiments that are somewhat text-agnostic—that have a focus on what &lt;em&gt;editions&lt;/em&gt; can do, not what &lt;em&gt;an edition&lt;/em&gt; can do for &lt;em&gt;a specific text&lt;/em&gt;. Alan Galey’s Visualizing Variation coding project is another recent example of textual experimentation, that focuses on edition form over any one text. His code set is a scholarly response, to the early modern experience of reading, when spellings varied wildly, and a reader was accustomed to holding multiple possible meanings for badly printed or ambiguously spelled words in their mind at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, his “Animated Variants” code cycles which word to display in the reading text, for contended words such as Hamlet’s sallied/solid/sullied, so that the reader isn’t biased by a word’s placement in the main text, rather than in the footnotes. By experimenting with digital means of approximating this historical experience, Galey moves theorists past discussing that this different experience of texts occurred. Instead, scholars can now respond to an actual participation in that historical experience. Galey’s coded textual experiments are themselves critical arguments about edition design. His example of a project where the principal investigator is also the lead programmer was a helpful model for my coding work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.009.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen how textual scholarship uses edition design experiments, to develop interpretive interfaces. I’d like to switch now to discussing how those edition interfaces are used, when exposed to public readers and researchers.
Lindsey Thomas notes that making something freely available online does not necessarily guarantee that thing is public, or that it will be used as a public resource. It isn’t enough to make something theoretically publicly accessible to advance a public humanities. We need to prioritize accessibility, inclusion, and education, if we want to create a real conversation among academics and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.010.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My project both designed for participation by public readers, and used participatory design by incorporating users’ feedback during the design process. In the world of textual scholarship, my edition has precedents in digital editions that allowed site visitors to transcribe, mark up, and annotate texts. The Shelley-Godwin Archive has worked toward public participation, envisioning an eventual “work-site for scholars, students, and the general public” with “contributions in the form of transcriptions, corrections, and annotations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the valuing of participation from all levels of expertise even in the beta site, where a stoplight icon visually signals the reliability of a text’s transcription, allowing non-expert markup and transcription to be made public more quickly. The New York Public Library’s &lt;em&gt;Candide 2.0&lt;/em&gt; offered public annotation alongside the novel: stating “the margin is a public space where readers can congregate, discuss and debate the book together, in intimate proximity to the text”. Participation privileges developed in stages: commissioned annotators seeded the edition with expert commentary, after which the edition was opened to public annotation for a trial period. The London Lives project similarly used a graded approach to participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.011.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve distilled my review of pertinent literature into several calls for further work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need models for conducting and analyzing user studies in the digital humanities and textual studies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need digital editions that are both public and participatory. Designing and coding participatory digital editions lets textual scholars serve more than one of the field’s intellectual values: &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; our mandate as humanists to preserve and renew the relevance of past culture, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the focus on more intimate knowledge of texts via edition-building and the interpretive work that entails.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What a digital Ulysses would do has been theorized; recent changes to the text’s digital availability mean we now need to build and test those theories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll next give you a brief tour of the edition I created in response to these calls to action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.012.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the current front page of the edition. The images give a high level tour of the edition’s features: you can highlight parts of the book and annotate those highlights; read others’ annotations; and personalize what annotations you see to your background, interests, and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.013.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an allusion to Hamlet, an annotator might explain the reference and also tag the annotation with tags like “meaning” (a tag we’ve been using to call out answers to “what does this mean?”) as well as tags like “Shakespeare”, “Hamlet”, and “intertextuality”. Other popular tags mark if an annotation translates a specific language, refers to a specific author or book or to Joyce’s biography, or relates to a topic such as Modernist style, colonialism, or religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.014.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers click on highlighted text to see any annotations tied to that highlight; these annotations appear in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.015.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each annotation on the text can receive either one upvote or one downvote from each reader. Annotation votes accrue to the user who authored those annotations, so that helpfulness and credibility of annotators can also be very roughly assessed. These votes allow readers to prioritize what annotations they are shown, when a word or phrase has multiple annotations. For example, a reader can choose to see the top-rated annotations first, or the newest annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers can also favorite annotations to save them into a personal list; I hope to eventually tie this feature into the filtering system so that users can share links to “custom” editions only showing their curated annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.016.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers can filter annotations to only display annotations dealing with areas of interest (e.g. if you’re interested in references to Shakespeare’s plays). Readers can also filter to only display annotations authored by certain users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.017.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The edition, after being open in beta or testing mode about one month, has a couple hundred user accounts (367 on Sunday) and a couple hundred annotations (416 on Sunday) (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post-defense note: when I quote the first month of open beta stats in my talks, the numbers are much, much higher: that’s because Infinite Ulysses made the Daily Top 20 on Hacker News the morning after my defense, bringing in thousands of site visitors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of those user accounts who are actually actively annotating while reading is very low so far. There were two fairly active users on the site besides myself (they added 60 and 19 annotations), with 10 users authoring 5 or more annotations, 20 users authoring 2 or more annotations, and 32 site users authoring at least 1 annotation. All but 4 of those 29 annotators are people I’d never met before. I expect site activity to pick up as more of the book is annotated, and several teachers are already planning to use the site with classes this summer and fall. It’s also worth noting that the first two chapters of the book are fairly thickly annotated by me already (around 240 annotations), so new readers might not have felt they had as much to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.018.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of code, my biggest intervention was to create a module that ties the highlighting of text from the Annotator tool, into how Drupal lets you add metadata to, filter, and sort units of content such as annotations. These social features, filtering, and sorting addressed a need already present even at the level of a few hundreds readers on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most-annotated page on the site after four weeks of the open beta had 45 annotations, with the next ten most-annotated pages each having between 10 and 25 annotations per page. Even at the level of an edition just beginning to see use, there are already too many annotations per page for most readers; we already need a way to filter out the distraction of the annotations that don’t fit our interests. In particular, the site has been read by both first-time readers of the novel and professors who have taught the text; sorting and filtering helps get the appropriate granularity of annotation to each reader, whether that’s “what does this word mean?” or “how does this dialogue fit into what we know about Joyce’s opinions on Irish politics?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.019.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite Ulysses and the dissertational project around it modeled small but actionable changes to the fields of the digital humanities and textual scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of participatory projects, Infinite Ulysses provided an example of a small but eager audience for a participatory digital humanities project; although the data gathered on site visits is early, there were over 2000 sessions of site use and over 1500 unique site visitors during this first month of open testing. The code and design work that allows textual annotations to be curated and moderated are being tested on at least two other digital editions (the Shelley-Godwin Archive and Romantic Circles); further work toward packaging and documenting the code will allow for digital humanists with less technical expertise to set up similar participatory annotation projects for their own texts, theories, and testing. Early site use data suggests that the site’s design and functionalities do represent a working route, for digital editions to support public participation, through personalization of annotations to reader and researcher needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of meaningful crowdsourcing, Infinite Ulysses provided a modest example of public digital edition visitors adding value to a text, through contextualizing and interpretive annotations over a trial month. The project also outlined a number of ways digital humanities researchers may use non-critical participation to advance scholarly knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of edition design and data, Infinite Ulysses experimented with digital edition editorial statements by providing a detailed explanation of how scholarly values were manifested through specific instances of project design and code. Preliminary data gathering and analysis provided support and pointed out flaws in my digital edition design, while also providing text-agnostic knowledge about user testing methods for participatory digital editions, that can be used by other textual scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of textual scholarship field boundaries, I’ve explored scholarly textual artifacts that draw on the values and skills of textual scholarship, without necessarily looking like a scholarly edition. By distilling textual scholarship values from their common embodiments and saving the term “scholarly edition” for a very specific type of edition, we can let the term “edition” invite broader types of textual projects that still hold true to textual scholarship values. Re-examining core assumptions about technologies like the edition can open new possibilities for humanities knowledge, and it can also help edition reviewers provide more constructive critique that better fits individual digital editions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.020.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New questions, not unexpectedly, arose from my research. I’ll want to explore the possibilities for “non-critical” but meaningful participation I’ve listed in the whitepaper, looking for projects that have tested these possibilities, and creating wireframes and prototypes exploring the untested participation methods among my suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll want to think further about design that specifically scaffolds critical digital edition participation: how can we teach critical ways of reading Ulysses without belaboring existing theories? (Teach methods, not content.) I’ll also continue analysis of site data and user feedback, using these to reassess the edition’s curation and moderation functionalities as more readers and classrooms use the edition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, I’ll add to the discussion around editorial statements for digital editions by crafting a more detailed methodological statement for Infinite Ulysses, one that focuses on the choices of design and code that perform the edition’s values, and then seeking a platform for peer review of my methodology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My distillation of textual scholarly values would only benefit from drawing in more diverse examples from the history of the field, as well as circulating my arguments for feedback and refinement. And I think the field would benefit from drawing up suggested guidelines for reviewing editions that aim at participation, something I hope to think through with members of the Shelley-Godwin team.
These steps should both improve Infinite Ulysses as a textual resource, and add to our body of knowledge about designing a more public, participatory digital humanities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.021.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(End of formal dissertation defense presentation.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-about-this-dissertation&quot;&gt;More about this dissertation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in reading more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; or the dissertation around it, the dissertation exists as &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dissertation.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;dissertation.amandavisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; was the URL I used pre-defense), which functions as an umbrella documenting all the pieces of my dissertational effort: blog posts, code repositories, links, the dissertation’s whitepaper (written just in the final month before the defense, as an analytical debriefing), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;the full set of blog posts written during my dissertation available here&lt;/a&gt;, which talk not only about the focus of my research (digital humanities design, Joyce, textual scholarship, annotation) but about the practical aspects of designing and pursuing a digital dissertation. Also, I’m always happy to answer questions &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com&quot;&gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-slides&quot;&gt;Bonus slides&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some extra slides and talking points ready for questions I anticipated, or for things I didn’t have time for in the presentation but wanted to be sure to cover. One of the anticipated questions was “Is Infinite Ulysses an edition?”, so I was very prepared to argue that it isn’t a &lt;em&gt;scholarly digital edition&lt;/em&gt; (which is a term of art meaning certain methods and rigor), but that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a digital edition. I blog that argument soon, for anyone who hasn’t heard me present on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of these slides intrigue you, feel free to contact me, or check out my dissertation whitepaper at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Digital Humanities Dissertation Defense Advice</title>
   <link href="/2016/06/14/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-advice"/>
   <updated>2016-06-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/06/14/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-advice</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently realized that although &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;I thoroughly blogged my dissertation (almost 40 blog posts)&lt;/a&gt; and wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2015/05/09/dissertationdefended&quot;&gt;a post after successfully defending the dissertation in April 2015&lt;/a&gt;, I never blogged my actual defense talk. In keeping with &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;blogging the job talk&lt;/a&gt; that took me into my current job, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/grad-advice/&quot;&gt;other DH/grad student advice&lt;/a&gt;, I am now rectifying this oversight! I’ll make a few comments about the defense process in this blog post, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/20/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk&quot;&gt;I blogged the actual talk in a separate post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knowing-what-to-expect&quot;&gt;Knowing what to expect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend attending at least one dissertation defense in your department, preferably early in your degree. (I was lucky to get to attend two excellent literature defenses that incorporated digital humanities: Jason Rhody’s defense of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hdl.handle.net/1903/11161&quot;&gt;Game Fiction&lt;/a&gt;, and Lisa Rhody’s defense of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hdl.handle.net/1903/13969&quot;&gt;Ekphrastic Revisions: Verbal-Visual Networks in 20th Century Poetry by Women&lt;/a&gt;.) It was extremely useful for me to learn early on that defenses aren’t necessarily the scary things they’re made out to be in popular culture. If things go right, you should only be defending because your advisor thinks you’re ready—at that point, you have the expertise, and the defense is your opportunity to showcase the experience you’ve built up over the years of dissertational work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defense experience can be pretty similar to the orals/comps (&lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2012/11/27/info-dump-humanities-doctoral-candidacy-exams-advice/&quot;&gt;advice on those here&lt;/a&gt;), both in terms of practical preparation you can do beforehand (anticipate questions you’ll be asked, know what the room will look like where you’ll present) and in the experience (have your first five minutes just about memorized, and after that hope to relax and enjoy the chance to discuss your work—and nothing but!—with smart people for an hour.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a chance to present a version of your talk to another grad student or family—or even better, at a conference or other public venue—I’d recommend using that time to get comfortable with your talk, so that your focus just before the defense can be on the Q&amp;amp;A rather than the presentation. &lt;strong&gt;Fun fact:&lt;/strong&gt; I was going to give a Digital Dialogue at MITH the week before my defense, but the electricity across campus went out while I was on my first slide and stayed out the rest of the day, so we had to reschedule for the week &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; my defense. Didn’t get to practice the talk publicly, but I did end up feeling like nothing worse could happen during the actual defense, so it worked out all right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prepare-but-dont-worry&quot;&gt;Prepare, but don’t worry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky and privileged to have had &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/#preservation&quot;&gt;an amazing committee&lt;/a&gt;, an audience with some friendly faces (thanks, Porter, Kyle, and Jordan!), and a really positive experience—but I recognize that you should also be prepared for less ideal outcomes. We’ve all heard about questioners showing up without reading the full dissertation, and questions framed as interrogation rather than an invitation for you to share your unique expertise. At the same time, I really want to emphasize that &lt;strong&gt;the defense isn’t something to overly worry about&lt;/strong&gt;: compared to all the work you’ve done to get to this point, the defense is a time-limited situation, specific to what you’ve been thinking and working on for years, and at this moment &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are better prepared for it than anyone else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things you can do, if you are in a situation where it’s not clear the room will be entirely friendly: Practice phrases for steering confusing questions and defining the discussion in your own terms. In particular, I’d practice “double evasion” of off-topic questions, since I’ve seen this fluster conference speakers: if an audience member asks you about something that you’re not claiming expertise in via your dissertation, you can start by noting this difference but speculating briefly on possibilities, then have a statement ready if they press you again to talk about some topic outside your focus (e.g. “As I said, x and not y was the focus of my research, and you might be interested to know that [thing about x tangentially related to y and segue back into your area of research]”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My awesome advisor (Matt Kirschenbaum) also talked me through all the possible outcomes of the defense (I think these were: accepted without revisions, accepted pending revisions, or requiring a second defense? The norm tended toward being accepted with or without revisions, and if I needed revisions I shouldn’t feel bad about it). It was good to know what the best through worst possible outcomes could be (and that none were too terrible). Also, this let me emotionally prepare myself for being okay with a request for revisions (against a perfectionist streak I’m sure I share with a majority of people doing graduate studies). (I did end up passing without needing revisions, yay!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also talked about an unlikely but possible scenario for any grad student doing DH work: that someone with an ax to grind about digital scholarship shows up to the public part of the defense and makes trouble. This felt unlikely enough that I was able to not worry about it, but at the same time I had prepared for public challenges to the scholarly nature of my work. A weekly email to my advisor as a record of what I’d been doing wasn’t just motivation for me, it also kept a log we could produce if what I had been doing was questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’m leaving things out, so feel free to email (aviscont@purdue.edu) or tweet (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/Literature_Geek&quot;&gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt;) me with any questions about the defense process (note that particulars will vary by university and department, of course). I’ll share my actual defense talk in the next post early next week when I’m back from the Joyce conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-about-this-dissertation&quot;&gt;More about this dissertation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in reading more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; or the dissertation around it, the dissertation exists as &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dissertation.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;dissertation.amandavisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; was the URL I used pre-defense), which functions as an umbrella documenting all the pieces of my dissertational effort: blog posts, code repositories, links, the dissertation’s whitepaper (written just in the final month before the defense, as an analytical debriefing), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/20/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk&quot;&gt;text and slides from my thesis defense are in this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;the full set of blog posts written during my dissertation available here&lt;/a&gt;, which talk not only about the focus of my research (digital humanities design, Joyce, textual scholarship, annotation) but about the practical aspects of designing and pursuing a digital dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Infinite Ulysses beta closes for 1.0 work</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Infinite Ulysses’s open beta (March 2015-May 2016) has ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-this-means-for-currentprospective-users&quot;&gt;What this means for current/prospective users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you’re just interested in future plans for the site and an overview of how the beta period went, skip to the next section.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt; participatory edition to get some serious post-beta improvements, and I’ve decided the best way to do this is taking some time off from moderating the site while I focus on its web development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site will remain up and readable (except for short hours-long downtimes when pushing major improvements), but on July 15th I’ll be closing signups for new users as well as blocking logging in/annotating by existing users for a while. Please contact &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#117;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#117;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt; with any questions this choice raises (e.g. I can try to accommodate needs such as plans to use the site in a summer or fall course or reading group, or to demo the site on a given day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com/content/terms-use&quot;&gt;the site’s public data policy&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll be emailing site users this week with an invitation to export their annotations during the next six weeks (before July 15th, 2016). After that date, &lt;strong&gt;site users will not be able to log in until after the post-beta overhaul is complete&lt;/strong&gt; (currently no set date). Before July 15, logged-in users can use new links on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com/user&quot;&gt;your user profile page&lt;/a&gt; to export DOC, XML, and CSV versions of your annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note there’s no necessity to export your annotations&lt;/strong&gt;—they’ll still be there on the 1.0 site. Since from July 15, 2016 onward until the 1.0 release is ready there will be no new site signups and no logging in or annotating for existing users, I wanted to give you access to your annotations. If you don’t export your annotations during that time, you won’t lose them—an export of all user annotations will be available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-public/tree/master/Annotations&quot;&gt;in the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; (and I see no reason for it to not stay there as long as GitHub is around, so no rush). Please contact &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#117;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#117;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt; with any questions or special needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-a-hiatus&quot;&gt;Why a hiatus?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to have enough stuff ready to do a 1.0 release in time for this year’s Bloomsday and my speaking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://anniversaryjoyce.com/provisional-programme/day-5-friday-17-june/&quot;&gt;XXV International James Joyce Symposium that week&lt;/a&gt; (we’re doing a full day of digital+genetic editing panels all day on Friday, including Hans Gabler and Michael Groden—pretty exciting!). Alas, I won’t have time to finish my improvements by that deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to continuing work on the site, and I do think now that I’ve settled into my new job and have some support to expand the site into a team project from a solo dissertational one, I’ll be able to release something pretty cool. But I’m not yet at a place where I can commit to a release date, and instead of continually pushing that time off, I need to make a change to reduce the moderation and community design effort the site involves, and focus on the site’s web development without feeling constantly behind where I want the site to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The community deserves care.&lt;/strong&gt; Running a digital community is so rewarding, but I need to acknowledge that I don’t have the time to currently do everything the site requires—especially the constant vigilance against abuse and spam that the community absolutely deserves. I didn’t have time to focus on accessibility testing as much as I should have; the reading interface only works for limited window sizes and breaks after a certain level of magnification, which is a poor reward for anyone answering my invitation to a public &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; conversation. And I dislike continually pushing the date for the 1.0 changes back—it’s better for everyone if I wait to make a clear promise on when and what I can do with the site (more on what’s holding back changes farther below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My research trajectory.&lt;/strong&gt; I also need to acknowledge how my research interests are developing—I’ve always been primarily interested in participatory interface design for knowledge-building, and I think of myself as more of a research programmer and textual scholar, than as a Joycean or community manager. I’m also interested in putting my research efforts more squarely toward improving student and publics access, participation, and inclusion in the humanities, and in making the humanities (researchers, topics, and audiences) more diverse. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/05/27/inclusivityeditioncanon&quot;&gt;I’ve written about this a bit in a post on why I chose Ulysses for my edition, despite this supporting the problematic canon of white male authors writing in English&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t mean to say others shouldn’t be working in Joyce studies—this is a personal decision about where I want to put my time and effort going forward). I’m interested in inviting more people into the conversations around challenging literature, and less interested in spending my future specifically wed to Joyce’s texts (although I suspect I’ll continue to do silly &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/usurper/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2012/02/20/anachronistic-linati-schema&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/fun/marionette.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-the-edition&quot;&gt;Testing the edition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of user testing and feedback helped shape the current site, and will be the foundation for the 1.0 version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Informal (hallway testing, tweeted questions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk-aloud observation (single and paired)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participatory design (sketching ideal layouts)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Site contact form feedback &amp;amp; emailed feedback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GitHub issue queue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open beta soft launch survey with non-academic testers (March 5th, 2015)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open beta survey responses (March 9-30, 2015)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Analytics (going forward, I want to have a clear statement to users on what kind of information I can see)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aggregated mapping (heatmaps, scrollmaps, clickmaps)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drupal statistics on frequency and authorship of annotations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;howd-the-beta-go&quot;&gt;How’d the beta go?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open beta was a fantastic experience for me. We had some decent exposure via social media, helped in no small part by making the Hacker News Top 20 the day after my dissertation defense. As of June 2, 2016, the site had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;22,251 unique visitors&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;776 members&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1,167 annotations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;283 unique annotation tags&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A huge thanks to all the site’s beta testers&lt;/strong&gt;, who generously gave me feedback on the site’s design and how it fit their individual reader and research needs. (And another shout-out to all the people whose code and support made the site possible, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com/credits&quot;&gt;listed here&lt;/a&gt;—especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mwidner&quot;&gt;Michael Widner&lt;/a&gt;, whose development of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lacunastories.com/&quot;&gt;Lacuna annotation platform&lt;/a&gt; you should definitely check out!.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there wasn’t a race for quantity over quality, special thanks are due to the site’s power annotators for their generosity to our reader community, and for helping me design the next iteration of the site to better support heavy annotation: user &lt;strong&gt;tim finnegan&lt;/strong&gt; outpacing us all with 546 excellent annotations, followed by &lt;strong&gt;bbogle&lt;/strong&gt; (159) and by three users with 20-30 annotations each—&lt;strong&gt;pbohan&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;serinamarie89&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;wvarga7a1&lt;/strong&gt;. I also authored 248 annotations myself, although many of these were drawn from my earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com&quot;&gt;UlyssesUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt; annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hey, existing site users: I have stickers created as rewards for my alpha and beta testers now—if you used the site between now and back when it went live, send me an email with your mailing address by the end of June 2016 and I’ll ship you one! Subject to not running out of them, of course…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IUSticker.png&quot; alt=&quot;Infinite Ulysses publicity sticker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The nose fell out of the logo… still looks like a face to me…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers-are-nice-but&quot;&gt;The numbers are nice, but…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been amazing to have so many strangers interact with something I built—and the number of people who visited the site (22k+) is probably a bit unusual for a literature dissertation? But the reality of those numbers suggests that while there’s interest in the idea of the project, most of those visitors didn’t stick around long to read and didn’t come back any or many times. Check out this spike of interest right after my defense, and the relative flatline after—over half (about 14,000) of the 22,251 visitors came within the first month of the open beta, with the remaining 8,000 trickling in over the following year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/statriseandfall.png&quot; alt=&quot;Line chart of site visitors since the site when live, with spike in April 2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest in the digital humanities and in designing for a more participatory literature conversation is great, but that’s really just a tiny step—the real assessment is whether I can build something that goes beyond initial curiosity, and supports people reading selections or the whole book over weeks and months. Site account creation (required to annotate and use some other features) was low compared to the total number of visits, returning visits were low, and reading without annotating was largely the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, reading &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is a significant investment of time…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AlisonBechdelUlysses.png&quot; alt=&quot;Panel from Alison Bechdel&#39;s graphic novel Fun Home, showing the protagonist reading Ulysses and swearing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Panel from Alison Bechdel’s highly recommended graphic novel&lt;/em&gt; Fun Home)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…But as much as I like to see these stats as heartening, I know I have a lot of work to do in making the look and feel of the site a delightful experience, and in making major changes to the site’s functionality supporting how people are most comfortable reading (a frequent request, touch annotation to allow comfy armchair reading, is held back by there not currently being a fully functioning plugin for this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the concerns above about keeping the annotations a safe, welcoming space for including diverse voices in the &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; conversation, I need to think through supporting a community with unusual ebbs and flows of activity. Once hooked, print readers do frequently come back to &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; for many rereads. Even with rereaders, though, most users will come to the print book or website for stretches of weeks or months, then disappear for a while. Keeping the site feeling alive meanwhile—for example, making sure readers’ new questions get answered—takes regular effort that I don’t have enough time to support myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotators, assemble!&lt;/strong&gt; I do have some ideas for addressing this ebb and flow of the reading community, and for getting the site back into a schedule of regular improvements. I’ll be thinking about how to turn the site into a community-led project: I have funding for a graduate research assistant, some offers to push improved code to the site once I’ve got the repo ready, and the hope that the project can be a space for students and staff to train in various areas of DH interest (coding, scholarly digital editing, social media work…). I’m also working on a project that will make sharing new functionalities between digital editions easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A reading-sprint model.&lt;/strong&gt; Once the 1.0 site is ready, I’m interested in trying out a reading-sprint model, where I’d advertise an approaching sprint several months in advance (optimistically, enough that any teacher could then plan to include in their course the following term), then open the site for a set period of reading by individuals, book clubs, and classes—knowing that I had team in place to support the community (curation, moderation, guidance) through that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removing the account requirement.&lt;/strong&gt; I also want to recognize that even with a delightful look and intuitive functionality, not all readers will want to annotate or sign up for the site. I need to build things so that all features except annotation and comments are open without a user account (early on, I focused over much on sign-ups as a way of tracking a threshold of site engagement—but ease of use is more important than nice stats!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splitting the text.&lt;/strong&gt; I also plan to divide the site into two interlinked texts: one text with a curated set of annotations, aimed at the bulk of people arriving at the site who just want some help reading &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;. The second text will be the place for experimenting with new features and with diverse kinds of annotation (Team Mulligan? reader injokes? annotating as the book’s characters? check, check, and check!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This split into two texts should take some of the burden off human moderators—the curated text can have annotations pulled in from the experimental text as time allows, while the experimental text can be a little more open to various kinds and granularities of annotation (though I’ll still have mechanics in place to report abuse, ask for moderation, and to require a few good-faith annotations before your annotations are visible to anyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;best-laid-plans-vs-real-life&quot;&gt;Best-laid plans vs. real life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why I keep pushing the 1.0 version off. I had a handful of site improvements I’d meant to release last Bloomsday (a couple weeks after my graduation), and lots of additional local work since then (e.g. moving annotations into a collapsible side drawer to aid tablet reading, and changing the theme to support smaller screens and greater screen magnification were big ones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dissertation scope repercussions.&lt;/strong&gt; I was lucky in having a lovely dissertation experience. But because the final beta version of the site was built largely during the final year of my dissertation (after a lot of research and trying out other tech platforms and code libraries), I didn’t have time to put in place everything I’d normally do for a professional job. Sometimes visual design suffered for the sake of functionalities I needed to move user testing forward; scope tightened and pieces dropped out (e.g. comment threading display was buggy, so I ended up just removing commenting on annotations for the beta).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incremental improvements are currently hard to push.&lt;/strong&gt; It was difficult to push incremental changes to the site; for example, simply removing the up/down voting button (an early decision) couldn’t happen until I had time to modify the site’s theme to accommodate how the annotation structure would shift into the resulting gap, or the whole display would be out of whack. The text I chose ended up having needing manual addition of Joyce’s typographic choices, and having many more OCR errors than I expected—and as with other site changes, making it possible for site users to correct errors themselves wasn’t an easy thing to add, although users were generous with locating errors. There were a lot of small things like that, and the solution really needs to be a general overhaul rather than a collage of bandaids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work is getting done, albeit not pushed to the live site.&lt;/strong&gt; Since defending the dissertation, I’ve been working locally on a bunch of other improvements, starting with a complete from-scratch rebuilding of the site’s database and theme. I’ve been able to share my code for testing on development versions of several other digital editions (Romantic Circles, the Shelley-Godwin Archive, and the Victorian COVE site I’m co-PI’ing with Dino Felluga), and I made some headway toward packaging my code for easier reuse by others at the CODEX hackathon in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with starting a new job, settling into post-student life, and moving to a new place, I haven’t been able to make the concentrated clumps of time I need to finish things up—just hours here and there, with days in between. Despite journaling constantly alongside my webdev work, it’s hard to pick work back up swiftly after putting it down for weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recognize that in trying to connect and grow the digital humanities community at Purdue, I might not have time to set this all up in the near future. The hope is to get the site to a place where others can participate in improving the site if they’re interested in doing so, but I recognize that I’ve been pushing “improvements soon!” off for a while now, and that isn’t the best situation for either me or the site’s readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fun project, and I’ve been honored by the generosity of others in helping me build something better. So: I’m going to stop saying the new site will be ready soon, and wait until I can make and keep a promise about the site’s next version. I hope that this is a reasonable way to do that (any suggestions or requests to improve how I’m implementing this decision are welcomed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;read-more-stuff-related-to-infinite-ulysses&quot;&gt;Read more stuff related to Infinite Ulysses?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Infinite Ulysses site will remain available for looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; until it’s ready for further interactive use. If you’re interested in reading more about the work behind Infinite Ulysses, you might fancy the dissertation around the edition at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt;, including a whitepaper discussing stuff like designing interfaces for a public humanities, how public humanities participation can be meaningful without necessarily using full “critical” academic rhetoric, an analysis of past annotation and digital &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; projects as well as my Infinite Ulysses user testing, and some thoughts on whether Infinite Ulysses is an edition (for my textual scholarship peeps.) There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;the full set of blog posts written during my dissertation available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2016-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/05/09/aerospace-history-dh-projects-purdue-archives</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lib.purdue.edu/spcol&quot;&gt;Purdue University Archives &amp;amp; Special Collections&lt;/a&gt; (ASC) have an amazing aerospace history collection due to Purdue’s many students and faculty who were pilots (Amelia Earhart was faculty), went on to be astronauts, or worked in the aerospace industry. I’m working with the ASC towards digital humanities projects that increase public and student access to our collections; in particular, we’re planning to use 3D scanning and printing to make some of the more interesting, fragile, or rare artifacts more accessible to visitors and student researchers. Today, Flight Archivist Tracy Grimm kindly gave me a tour of some of the objects we’re thinking about using in our DH work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve shared some of the more interesting things below (sorry for shaky photo quality on a couple of these!). These photos were okayed for educational sharing on social media (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lib.purdue.edu/spcol/digital-reproduction-requests&quot;&gt;copyright info here&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested in using these somehow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1087.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelia Earhart’s goggles&lt;/strong&gt;. These are too fragile for regular handling; we want to explore using various types of 3D printing filament (pliable, glass-like) to replicate these as wearable facsimiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1088.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An ice pick Amelia Earhart used&lt;/strong&gt; to puncture open cans of tomato juice. She used these as a compact way of getting calories while flying. (I think Tracy said this was a specific brand—Beecham’s?—and that Earhart was used in their advertisements.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking out the safe inside the archives vault where artifacts are kept extra-secure, including Amelia Earhart’s scrapbooks and helmet, the smelling salts she used to keep awake during her flights, and flight suits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1090.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;glove&lt;/strong&gt; astronaut Eugene Cernan wore on the moon. Sealed in a bag so as not to lose any of the &lt;strong&gt;lunar dust&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1091.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1127.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A “frangible nut” from a space shuttle flown on by astronaut Janice Voss&lt;/strong&gt;. The nut was packed with explosive charges and separated from a rocket on takeoff (presented on a commemorative plaque). It’s quite heavy, and the edges are sharp where explosives sheared off the metal. The nuts were originally around 50 lbs, so this fragment is about 25 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1103.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1104.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1105.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1108.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1109.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1110.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronaut food&lt;/strong&gt; from the Mark N. Brown Papers collection, assumedly used during training on Earth. Each contains info on how to prepare the food. Potatoes au gratin, noodles and chicken, tapioca pudding, butter cookies! Each unit includes a small velcro dot (to anchor the food to something when there’s no gravity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1112.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly the coolest business card title: “&lt;strong&gt;Astronaut&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1115.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1118.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1122.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1124.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollo XVII LRV Map Book&lt;/strong&gt;, a commemorative binding of maps actually used on the moon by astronaut Eugene Cernan while traveling on the lunar rover. A broken fender on the lunar rover had to be repaired (while on the moon!) with 4 of the map pages (the Smithsonian has the repaired fender in its collection). The individual pages aren’t too interesting to look at, but we’re thinking about creating a digital quilt of the images and then augmenting this with historical and topographical information.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I published &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;a peer-reviewed piece on building your own scholarly blog or website at &lt;em&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week and am cross-posting the lesson here (but check it out at the Programming Historian, which has a bunch of fantastic DH lessons on other topics too!). The lesson was generously edited by Fred Gibbs and reviewed by Fred Gibbs, Paige Morgan, and Jaime Howe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;building-a-static-website-with-jekyll-and-github-pages&quot;&gt;Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This lesson is for you if&lt;/strong&gt; you’d like an entirely free, easy-to-maintain, preservation-friendly, secure website over which you have full control, such as a scholarly blog, project website, or online portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of this lesson&lt;/strong&gt;, you’ll have a basic live website where you can publish content that other people can visit—it will look like &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;!—and you’ll also have some resources to explore if you want to further customize the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; A computer (Mac/Windows/Linux are all okay, but this lesson doesn’t cover some aspects of Linux use), the ability to download and install software on the computer, an internet connection that can support downloading software. Users have reported needing between 1-3 hours to complete the entire lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty level:&lt;/strong&gt; Intermediate (this lesson includes use of the command line and git, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; walks you through anything needed to complete this lesson). Forthcoming lessons in the basics of git/GitHub and GitHub Pages will be linked here when available, and provide a good background for anyone wishing for deeper understanding of the technology used in this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-static-sites-jekyll-etc--why-might-i-care-a-idsection0a&quot;&gt;What are static sites, Jekyll, etc. &amp;amp; why might I care? &lt;a id=&quot;section0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This tutorial is built on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/&quot;&gt;official Jekyll Documentation&lt;/a&gt; written by the Jekyll community. See the &lt;a href=&quot;#section9-3&quot;&gt;“Read more”&lt;/a&gt; section below if you’d like to know even more about these terms!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dynamic-websites-static-websites--jekyll-a-idsection0-1a&quot;&gt;Dynamic websites, static websites, &amp;amp; Jekyll &lt;a id=&quot;section0-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamic websites&lt;/em&gt;, such as those created and managed by a content management system such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.com/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://omeka.org/&quot;&gt;Omeka&lt;/a&gt;, pull information from a database to fill in the content on a webpage. When you search for a book on Amazon.com, for example, the search results page you are shown didn’t already exist as a full HTML page; instead, Amazon.com has a template for search results page that includes things all results pages share (like the main menu and Amazon logo), but it queries the database to insert the results of that search you initiated into that template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Static websites&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, do not use a database to store information; instead, all information to be displayed on each webpage is already contained in an HTML file for that webpage. The HTML pages that make up a static site can be completely written by hand, or you can offload some of this work using something like Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jekyll&lt;/em&gt; is software that helps you “generate” or create a &lt;em&gt;static website&lt;/em&gt; (you may see Jekyll described as a “static site generator”). Jekyll takes page templates—those things like main menus and footers that you’d like shared across all the web pages on your site, where manually writing the HTML to include them on every webpage would be time-consuming. These templates are combined with other files with specific information (e.g. a file for each blog post on the site) to generate full HTML pages for website visitors to see. Jekyll doesn’t need to do anything like querying a database and creating a new HTML page (or filling in a partial one) when you visit a webpage; it’s already got the HTML pages fully formed, and it just updates them when/if they ever change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that when someone refers to a “Jekyll website”, they really mean a static (plain HTML) website that has been created using Jekyll. Jekyll is software that creates websites. Jekyll isn’t actually “running” the live website; rather, Jekyll is a “static site generator”: it helps you create the static site files, which you then host just as you would any other HTML website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because static sites are really just text files (no database to complicate matters), you can easily &lt;em&gt;version&lt;/em&gt; a static site—that is, use a tool to keep track of the different versions of the site over time by tracking how the text files that compose the site have been altered. Versioning is especially helpful when you need to merge two files (e.g. two students are writing a blog post together, and you want to combine their two versions), or when you want compare files to look for differences among them (e.g. “How did the original About page describe this project?”). Versioning is great when working with a team (e.g. helps you combine and track different people’s work), but it’s also useful when writing or running a website on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github--github-pages-a-idsection0-2a&quot;&gt;GitHub &amp;amp; GitHub Pages &lt;a id=&quot;section0-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a free place to store the files that run a website and host that website for people to visit (it only works for particular types of website, like basic HTML sites or Jekyll sites, and does not host databases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a visual way to use &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/documentation&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a system for &lt;em&gt;versioning&lt;/em&gt;: keeping track of changes to computer files (including code and text documents) over time (as explained &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-1&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re curious, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/&quot;&gt;a friendly lesson for exploring GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-reasons-for-using-a-static-website-a-idsection0-3a&quot;&gt;What are the reasons for using a static website? &lt;a id=&quot;section0-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.com/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://omeka.org/&quot;&gt;Omeka&lt;/a&gt; are good for the needs of complex, interactive websites like Amazon or an interactive digital edition of a novel—but for many blogs, project websites, and online portfolios, a static website (such as a website created using Jekyll) can do everything you need while providing some nice perks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;: Updates and maintenance are needed far less often (less than once a year vs. weekly-monthly).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preservation:&lt;/strong&gt; No database means that the text files making up your site are all you need to save to preserve and replicate your site. It’s easy to back your site up or submit it to an institutional repository.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Because there isn’t a database and there aren’t a bunch of code files providing features you might not even need, there are far fewer actual pieces of your website—it’s easier to go through them all and actually know what each does, should you be so inclined. Therefore, it’s much easier to become both a basic and an advanced Jekyll user.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More customization possible&lt;/strong&gt;: Since learning to master your website is easier, things you’ll definitely want to do, like changing the look (the “theme”) of a Jekyll-created site, are much easier than altering the look of a WordPress or Drupal site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free hosting:&lt;/strong&gt; While many website tools like Drupal, WordPress, and Omeka are free, hosting them (paying for someone to serve your website’s files to site visitors) can cost money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versioning:&lt;/strong&gt; Hosting on GitHub Pages means your site is linked into GitHub’s visual interface for git versioning, so you can track changes to your site and always roll back to an earlier state of any blog post, page, or the site itself if needed. This includes uploaded files you might want to store on the site, like old syllabi and publications. (Versioning is &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-1&quot;&gt;explained in more detail above&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no database to protect from hackers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Minimal website files and no database to query mean a faster page-loading time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a static website using Jekyll offers more perks in addition to all the benefits of a hand-coded HTML static website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s easier to get started customizing your site and writing its content, since you won’t need to learn or use HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built for blogging:&lt;/strong&gt; Jekyll was built to support blog posts, so it’s easy to blog (add new, date-sorted content) and do related tasks like display an archive of all blog posts by month, or include a link to the three most recent blog posts at the bottom of each post.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Templating automates repeated tasks:&lt;/strong&gt; Jekyll makes it easy to automate repeated website tasks via its “templating” system: you can create content that should, for example, appear on the header and footer of every page (e.g. logo image, main menu), or following the title of every blog post (e.g. author name and publication date). This templated information will automatically be repeated on every appropriate webpage, instead of forcing you to manually rewrite that information on every webpage where you want it to appear. Not only does this save a lot of copying and pasting—if you ever want to change something that appears on every page of your website (e.g. a new site logo or a new item in the main menu), changing it once in a template will change in on every place it appears on your website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparing-for-installation-a-idsection1a&quot;&gt;Preparing for installation &lt;a id=&quot;section1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re ready to get to work! In the rest of this lesson, we’re going to get a few programs installed on your computer, use the command line to install a few things that can only be installed that way, look at and customize a private version of your website, and finally make your website publicly accessible on the Web. If you run into problems at any point in this lesson, see the &lt;a href=&quot;#section9&quot;&gt;help section&lt;/a&gt; for how to ask questions or report issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we’ll make sure you have a couple things ready on your computer for when we need them later in the lesson by covering what operating system you can use (i.e. Mac/Windows/Linux), creating a GitHub account and installing the GitHub app, why you should use a “text editor” program to work on your website, and how to use the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything this lesson has you install is a standard and trusted web development tool, so it isn’t important to know exactly what each of these things do before installing it. I’ll try to balance more information about the things it’s most useful for you to fully understand, with providing a brief explanation for each piece and also link to further information in case you’d like to know more about what you’re putting on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operating-systems-a-idsection1-0a&quot;&gt;Operating systems &lt;a id=&quot;section1-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial should be usable by both Mac and Windows users. Jekyll can also work for Linux; this tutorial uses the GitHub Desktop software (Mac and Windows only) for simplicity, but Linux users will need to use git over the command line instead (not covered here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll isn’t officially supported for Windows, which means none of the official Jekyll documentation (the pages that walk you through setting up Jekyll and what its different pieces do, which you could consult instead of or in addition to this lesson) addresses Windows use. I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey/&quot;&gt;David Burela’s Windows instructions&lt;/a&gt; to note the places in the &lt;a href=&quot;#section2&quot;&gt;“Installing Dependencies” section&lt;/a&gt; when Windows users should do something different; the rest of the lesson should work the same for both Mac and Windows users, though note that screenshots throughout the lesson are all from a Mac (so thing may look slightly different for a Windows user).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github-user-account-a-idsection1-1a&quot;&gt;GitHub user account &lt;a id=&quot;section1-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A GitHub user account will let you host your website (make it available for others to visit) for free on GitHub (we’ll cover how in a later step). As a bonus, it will also let you keep track of versions of the website and its writing as it grows or changes over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub.com&lt;/a&gt; and click on the “Sign up” button on the upper right. Write your desired username. This will be visible to others, identify you on GitHub, and also be part of your site’s URL; for example, the author’s GitHub username is amandavisconti and her demo Jekyll site’s URL is http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/. (&lt;em&gt;Note you can also purchase your own domain name and use it for this site, but that won’t be covered in this tutorial&lt;/em&gt;). Also write your desired email address and password, then click “Create an account”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the next page, click the “Choose” button next to the “Free” plan option, ignore the “Help me set up an organization next” checkbox, and click “Finish sign up”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional&lt;/em&gt;: Visit https://github.com/settings/profile to add a full name (can be your real name, GitHub user name, or something else) and other public profile information, if desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github-desktop-app-a-idsection1-2a&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop app &lt;a id=&quot;section1-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GitHub Desktop app will make updating your live website (one we set it up) easy—instead of using the command line every time you want to update your site, you’ll be able to use an easier visual tool to update your site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop site&lt;/a&gt; and click on the “Download GitHub Desktop” button to download the GitHub Desktop software to your computer (Mac and Windows only; Linux users will need to use git just via the command line, which is not covered in this version of the tutorial).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the file has completely downloaded, double-click on it and use the following directions to install GitHub Desktop…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the username and password for the GitHub.com account you created using the steps above. (Ignore the “Add an Enterprise Account” button.) Click “Continue”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the name and email address you want the work on your site to be associated with (probably just your public name and work email address, but it’s up to you!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the same page, click the “Install Command Line Tools” button and enter your computer’s username and password if prompted (then click the “Install Helper” button on the prompt). After you get a popup message that all command line tools have successfully installed, click continue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The last page will ask “Which repositories would you like to use?”. Ignore this and click the “Done” button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional:&lt;/em&gt; Follow the walkthrough of the GitHub Desktop app that will appear (this isn’t necessary; we will cover anything you need to do with GitHub in this lesson).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;text-editor-a-idsection1-3a&quot;&gt;Text editor &lt;a id=&quot;section1-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to download and install a “text editor” program on your computer for making small customizations to your Jekyll site’s code. Good free options include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html&quot;&gt;TextWrangler&lt;/a&gt; (Mac) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&quot;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt; (Windows). Software aimed at word processing, like Microsoft Word or Word Pad, isn’t a good choice because it’s easy to forget how to format and save the file, accidentally adding in extra and/or invisible formatting and characters that will break your site. You’ll want something that specifically can save what you write as plaintext (e.g. HTML, Markdown).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional:&lt;/em&gt; See &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-2&quot;&gt;the “Authoring in Markdown” section below&lt;/a&gt; for notes on a Markdown-specific editing program, which you may also wish to install when you get to the point of authoring webpages and/or blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;command-line-a-idsection1-4a&quot;&gt;Command line &lt;a id=&quot;section1-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command line is a way to interact with your computer using text: it lets you type in commands for actions from simpler things such as “show me a list of the files in this directory” or “change who is allowed to access this file”, to more complex behavior. Sometimes there are nice visual ways to do things on your computer (e.g. the GitHub Desktop app &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-2&quot;&gt;we installed above&lt;/a&gt;), and sometimes you’ll need to use the command line to type out commands to get your computer to do things. The Programming Historian has &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash&quot;&gt;an in-depth lesson exploring the command line written&lt;/a&gt; by Ian Milligan and James Baker if you want more information than provided here, but this lesson will cover everything you need to know to complete the lesson (and we’ll only use the command line when it’s necessary or much easier than a visual interface).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the command line uses text commands, a “graphical user interface” (aka GUI) is what you probably normally use to work with your computer: anything where commands are given through a visual interface containing icons, images, mouse-clicking, etc. is a GUI. Often it’s simpler and faster to type in (or cut and paste from a tutorial) a series of commands via the command line, than to do something using a GUI; sometimes there are things you’ll want to do for which no one has yet created a GUI, and you’ll need to do them via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default command line program is called “Terminal” on Macs (located in &lt;em&gt;Applications &amp;gt; Utilities&lt;/em&gt;), and “Command Prompt”, “Windows Power Shell”, or “Git Bash” on Windows (these are three different options that each differ in the type of commands they accept; we’ll go in detail on which you should use later in the lesson).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is what a command line window looks like on the author’s Mac (using Terminal). You’ll see something like the &lt;em&gt;Macbook-Air:~ DrJekyll$&lt;/em&gt; below in your command line window; that text is called the “prompt” (it’s prompting you to input commands). In the screenshot, &lt;em&gt;Macbook-Air&lt;/em&gt; is the name of my computer, and &lt;em&gt;DrJekyll&lt;/em&gt; is the user account currently logged in (the prompt will use different names for your computer and username).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked to open a command line window and enter commands in this lesson, keep the following in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commands that you should type (or copy/paste) into the command line are formatted like this:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example of code formatting&lt;/code&gt;. Each formatted chunk of code should be copied and pasted into the command line, followed by pressing enter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let installation processes run &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; before entering new commands.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes typing a command and pressing enter produces an instantaneous result; sometimes lots of text will start to fill up the command line window, or the command line window will seem to not be doing anything (but something is actually happening behind the scenes, like downloading a file). &lt;strong&gt;When you’ve typed a command and hit enter, you’ll need to wait for that command to completely finish before typing &lt;em&gt;anything else&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or you might stop a process in the middle, causing problems. 
{0}. You’ll know your command has completed when the command line spits out the prompt again (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Macbook-Air:~ DrJekyll$&lt;/em&gt; on the author’s computer). See the screenshot below for an example of inputting a command, followed by some text showing you what was happening while that command was processed (and sometimes asking you to do something, like enter your password), and finally the reappearance of the command prompt to let you know it’s okay to type something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you need to do something else at the command line and don’t want to wait, just open a separate command line window (on a Mac, hit command-N or go to &lt;em&gt;Shell &amp;gt; New Window &amp;gt; New Window with Settings-Basic&lt;/em&gt;) and do things there while waiting for the process in the other command line window to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typing or pasting in the same commands a lot, or want to remember something you typed earlier? You can type the &lt;strong&gt;↑&lt;/strong&gt; (up arrow) at the command line to scroll through recently typed commands; just press enter after the one you want to use appears.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installing-dependencies-a-idsection2a&quot;&gt;Installing dependencies &lt;a id=&quot;section2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ll install some software dependencies (i.e. code Jekyll depends on to be able to work), using the command line because there isn’t a visual interface for doing this. This section is divided into instructions for if you’re &lt;a href=&quot;#sectionMac&quot;&gt;On a Mac&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;#sectionWindows&quot;&gt;On Windows&lt;/a&gt;, so skip down to &lt;a href=&quot;#sectionWindows&quot;&gt;On Windows&lt;/a&gt; now if you’re using Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-a-mac-a-idsectionmaca&quot;&gt;On a Mac &lt;a id=&quot;sectionMac&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re using a Mac computer, follow the instructions below until you hit a line that says the Windows-specific instructions are beginning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open a command line window (Applications &amp;gt; Utilities &amp;gt; Terminal) and enter the code shown in the steps below (&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code is formatted like this&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), keeping &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-4&quot;&gt;the command line tips from above&lt;/a&gt; in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;command-line-tools-suite-a-idsection2-1a&quot;&gt;Command line tools suite &lt;a id=&quot;section2-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to first install the Mac “command line tools” suite to be able to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; (which we’ll install next). Homebrew lets you download and install open-source software on Macs from the command line (it’s a “package manager”), which will make installing Ruby (the language Jekyll is built on) easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Terminal, paste the following code then press enter:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xcode-select --install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see something like the following text, followed by a popup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the popup, click the “Install” button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see a message that “The software was installed” when the installation is complete:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-2.5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;homebrew-a-idsection2-2a&quot;&gt;Homebrew &lt;a id=&quot;section2-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the command line tools suite has completed installation, return to your command line window and enter the following to install &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to press enter when prompted and enter your computer password when asked. For reference, below is a screenshot of the command entered into the author’s command line, followed by all the text that appeared (including the prompt to press enter, and to enter my password).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ruby--ruby-gems-a-idsection2-3a&quot;&gt;Ruby &amp;amp; Ruby Gems &lt;a id=&quot;section2-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is built from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;Ruby coding language&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby Gems&lt;/a&gt; makes setting up Ruby software like Jekyll easy (it’s a package manager, just like Homebrew—instead of making installation easy on Macs, it adds some stuff to make Ruby installations simpler).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install ruby&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to wait until the command prompt appears again to type the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install rubygems-update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nodejs-a-idsection2-4a&quot;&gt;NodeJS &lt;a id=&quot;section2-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot;&gt;NodeJS&lt;/a&gt; (or Node.js) is a development platform (in particular, a “runtime environment”) that does things like making Javascript run faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install node&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll-a-idsection2-5a&quot;&gt;Jekyll &lt;a id=&quot;section2-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is the code that creates your website (i.e. “site generation”), making it easier to do certain common tasks such as using the same template (same logo, menu, author information…) on all your blog post pages. There’s more info on &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-1&quot;&gt;what Jekyll and static sites are&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-3&quot;&gt;why you’d want to use Jekyll to make a static website&lt;/a&gt;, above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install jekyll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip the following steps (which are for Windows users only) and jump down to &lt;a href=&quot;#section3&quot;&gt;Setting up Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-windows-a-idsectionwindowsa&quot;&gt;On Windows &lt;a id=&quot;sectionWindows&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instructions for Windows users differ from those for Mac users just in this one “Installing dependencies” section. Only do the following if you’re using Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need a command line tool that recognizes the same commands Macs and Linux computers (i.e. Unix operating systems) do. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/downloads&quot;&gt;https://git-scm.com/downloads&lt;/a&gt; and click on the “Windows” link under “Downloads”. Once the download has finished, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the steps to install Git Bash (leave all options the way they already are).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open “Command Prompt” (open your Start Menu and search for “Command Prompt” and an app you can open should come up).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chocolatey is a “package manager”: code that lets you download and install open-source software on Windows easily from the command line. We’ll now install Chocolately (&lt;em&gt;make sure to highlight and copy the whole club of text below together, not as separate lines&lt;/em&gt;). Enter the code shown in the steps below (&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code is formatted like this&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), keeping &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-4&quot;&gt;the command line tips from above&lt;/a&gt; in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command &quot;(iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(&#39;https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1&#39;))) &amp;gt;$null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close the “Command Prompt” app and open “Git Bash” (which you recently installed) instead. &lt;strong&gt;You’ll now use Git Bash any time the command line is called for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jekyll is built from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;Ruby coding language&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby Gems&lt;/a&gt; makes setting up Ruby software like Jekyll easy (it’s a package manager, just like Homebrew—instead of making installation easy on Macs, it adds some stuff to make Ruby installations simpler). We’ll now install Ruby (this will take a few minutes):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;choco install ruby -y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close the command line program and restart (Ruby won’t work until you’ve done this once)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is the code that creates your website (i.e. “site generation”), making it easier to do certain common tasks such as using the same template (same logo, menu, author information…) on all your blog post pages. There’s more info on &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-1&quot;&gt;what Jekyll and static sites are&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-3&quot;&gt;why you’d want to use Jekyll to make a static website&lt;/a&gt;, above. We’ll now install Jekyll (if Windows Security gives you a warning popup, ignore it):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install jekyll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From now on, all instructions are for both Mac and PC users!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-jekyll-a-idsection3a&quot;&gt;Setting up Jekyll &lt;a id=&quot;section3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve now installed everything needed to make your website. In this section, we’ll use Jekyll to generate a new folder full of the files that constitute your website. We’ll also locate this folder in a place accessible to the GitHub Desktop app so they’re in the right place when we want to publish them as a public website later in the lesson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll need to know the file path to the GitHub folder created by installing the GitHub Desktop app (this is some text that says where a specific folder or file is within the directory tree on your computer, e.g. /Desktop/MyRecipes/Spaghetti.doc). If you don’t know the GitHub folder file path, click on the magnifying glass icon in the top right of your computer screen (on a Mac) or use the search field on the Start Menu (Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On Macs, a search box will appear in the middle of the screen; type in “GitHub”, then double-click on the “GitHub” option that appears under “Folders” to reveal the GitHub folder in Finder (this may look slightly different on Windows, but should function the same).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note that on some computers, this folder is instead labeled “GitHub for Macs” and may not show up on a search; if the previous steps didn’t locate a GitHub folder for you, navigate to Library &amp;gt; Application Support in Finder and check if a “GitHub for Mac” folder is located there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Right-click on the “GitHub” folder and choose “Copy ‘GitHub’”. The GitHub folder file path is now copied to your clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, write &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;, followed by a space, followed by the file path to your GitHub folder (either type it in if known, or press Command-v to paste in the file path you copied in the previous step). On the author’s computer (logged in as the user &lt;em&gt;DrJekyll&lt;/em&gt;) this command looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;cd&lt;/em&gt; command (&lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt;hange &lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;irectory) tells your computer to look at the place in the computer’s folder system you specify by the path typed after it—in this case, the path to the GitHub folder created by installing the GitHub Desktop app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your site’s public URL will take the form http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/, with &lt;em&gt;amandavisconti&lt;/em&gt; being the author’s GitHub username and &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; the name of the site I entered at this step (&lt;em&gt;an option to purchase and use your own &lt;a href=&quot;#section7-2&quot;&gt;custom URL&lt;/a&gt; is possible, but not covered in this lesson&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;Lowercase and uppercase website names do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; point to the same website automatically&lt;/strong&gt;, so unlike my &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; example you might wish to pick an all-lowercase name to make sure people who hear about the site tend to type its URL correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, type in the following (but replace &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; with whatever you want your site to be called):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new JekyllDemo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This command told &lt;em&gt;jekyll&lt;/em&gt; to create a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; site by installing all the necessary files in a folder named &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;The folder you create at this step (e.g. &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;) will be referred to as the “website folder” for the rest of this tutorial.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, type in the following to navigate into your site folder (through the rest of this lesson, always replace &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; with whatever name you chose for your site in the previous step):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd JekyllDemo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you look in the &lt;em&gt;GitHub &amp;gt; JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; folder in Finder, you’ll see that a bunch of new files—the files that will run your website!—have been installed (we’ll describe what each does &lt;a href=&quot;#section4-2&quot;&gt;further on in the lesson&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bundler is a Ruby “Gem” (a package of Ruby code that adds some specific feature to your site) that will make testing your site easier; it needs to be installed directly into the website folder we just created (e.g. &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;), which is why we didn’t install it earlier in this lesson. At the command line, enter:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install bundler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to wait until the command prompt appears again to type the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new file named “Gemfile” will appear in your website folder. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://tosbourn.com/what-is-the-gemfile/&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/a&gt; helps your site keep track of all the dependencies it requires to run without breaking (dependencies are pieces of code that software &lt;em&gt;depends&lt;/em&gt; on or requires, if you don’t want errors to occur).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate to your website folder in Finder (Macs) or your directory folder (Windows), and open the “Gemfile” file; you’ll want to open this and any future website files using your &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-3&quot;&gt;text editor&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. TextWrangler). To force a file to open with your text editor, right-click on the file, then chose “Open with” and select the text editor program (you may need to choose “Other…” to find the text editor if it isn’t in the list that appears).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-12.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can also drag and drop a text file onto the icon for your text editor program (e.g. on the Dock/menubar).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the two following lines of text, on separate lines and with the same lower-case formatting (as shown in the screenshot below), then &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
gem &#39;jekyll&#39;
gem &#39;github-pages&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-13.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, type&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This will install the &lt;em&gt;jekyll&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;github-pages&lt;/em&gt; gems you just listed in the Gemfile. (Don’t forget to let the entire process finish and the prompt reappear before typing any more commands! This process will take a few minutes, as a number of dependencies are being installed.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You won’t need to mess with the Gemfile again, since we’ll be hosting your website on GitHub Pages and GitHub Pages does not allow additional site dependencies or plugins (code that adds specific features, like social media buttons after every post; &lt;a href=&quot;#section7-2&quot;&gt;more on plugins below&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-a-website-locally-a-idsection3aa&quot;&gt;Running a website locally &lt;a id=&quot;section3a&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section will describe how to run your website&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;locally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;—meaning you’ll be able to see what your website will look like in a web browser just on your computer (aka locally), but not anywhere else. Working on a “local” version of a website means that it’s private to your computer; no one else can see your website yet (your website isn’t “live” or “public”: no one can type in the URL and see it in their browser).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This means you can experiment all you want, and only publish your site for the world to see when it’s ready. Or, once you’ve made your site live, you can continue to experiment locally with new writing, design, etc. and only add these to the public site once you’re happy with how they look on the local site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, type&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the command you’ll run whenever you want to view your website locally:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/em&gt; tells your computer to run Jekyll locally.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;–watch&lt;/em&gt; together with &lt;em&gt;bundle exec&lt;/em&gt; tells Jekyll to watch for changes to the website’s files, such as you writing and saving a new blog post or webpage, and to include these changes on refreshing your web browser. &lt;strong&gt;An exception to this&lt;/strong&gt; is the _config.yml file, which I’ll discuss in more detail in the next section (any changes made there &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; show up until you stop and restart Jekyll).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After typing in the command in the previous step, you’ll notice that the process never finishes. Remember how on the command line, if you type in anything while the previous command is still processing, you can cause problems? Jekyll is now being run from this command line window, so you’ll need to open a new command line window if you want to type other commands while your local site is still accessible to you (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-4&quot;&gt;the section on command line usage above&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-10.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Reports and error messages caused by changes you make to the files in the website folder will appear in this command line window, and are a good first place to check if something isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To stop running the site locally, press &lt;strong&gt;control-c&lt;/strong&gt; (this frees up the command line window for use again). Just enter &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt; again to start running the site locally again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;View your locally-running site by visiting &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll see a basic Jekyll website with boilerplate text:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-11.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mini-cheatsheet-a-idsection3a-1a&quot;&gt;Mini cheatsheet &lt;a id=&quot;section3a-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt; at the command line to start running your website locally. You’d visit &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/strong&gt; in a browser to see your local site now, but in the next section we’ll be changing things such that you’ll need to visit &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/strong&gt; to see the site from then on (filling in your website folder name for &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;, and making sure to include the last slash).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;strong&gt;control-c&lt;/strong&gt; at the command line to stop running the website locally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the site is running, after making changes to website files: save the files and refresh the webpage to see the changes—&lt;strong&gt;except for the _config.yml file&lt;/strong&gt;, for which you must stop running the website and restart running the website to see changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typing or pasting in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt; a lot? Instead, you can type the ↑ (up arrow) at the command line to scroll through recently typed commands; just press enter after the command you want to use appears.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tweaking-the-settings-a-idsection4a&quot;&gt;Tweaking the settings &lt;a id=&quot;section4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You now have a basic, private website accessible only on your computer. In this section, we’ll begin to customize your site by changing the website title and author information, and giving a brief overview of what the different website files do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-site-settings-via-configyml-a-idsection4-1a&quot;&gt;Basic site settings via _config.yml &lt;a id=&quot;section4-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate to your website folder in Finder (Macs) or the directory folder (Windows. The author’s website at &lt;em&gt;/Users/DrJekyll/GitHub/JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;DrJekyll&lt;/em&gt; is my logged in username, and &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; is the name of my website folder). &lt;a href=&quot;#section3&quot;&gt;Return to the “Setting up Jekyll” section&lt;/a&gt; if you need help locating your website folder.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-18.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll start by customizing the main settings file, &lt;strong&gt;_config.yml&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll want to open this and any future website files using your text editor (e.g. TextWrangler on Macs or Notepad++ on Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-15.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; file is a file “meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values for which your are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that” (as it says inside the file!). &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; is the place where you can set the title of your site, share information like your email address that you want associated with the site, or add other “basic settings”-type information you want available across your website.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;.yml&lt;/em&gt; file type refers to how the file is written using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML&quot;&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt; (the acronym standing for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”); YAML is a way of writing data that is both easy for humans to write and read, and easy for machines to interpret. You won’t need to learn much about YAML, besides keeping the &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; formatted the way it originally is even as you customize the text it contains (e.g. the title information is on a separate line from your email).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can change the text in this file, save the file, and then visit your local website in a browser to see the changes. &lt;strong&gt;Note that changes to _config.yml&lt;/strong&gt;, unlike the rest of your website files, will not show up if made while the website is already running; you need to make them while the website isn’t running, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; after making changes to _config.yml stop then start running the website, to see changes made to this particular file. (&lt;em&gt;Changes to the _config.yml file were left out of the ability to refresh because this file can be used to declare things like the structure of site links, and altering these while the site is running could badly break things.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Making small changes to website files (one at a time to start with), saving, and then refreshing to see the effect on your site means if you mess anything up, it will be clear what caused the issue and how to undo it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note that any line that starts with a &lt;strong&gt;#&lt;/strong&gt; sign is a &lt;em&gt;comment&lt;/em&gt;: comments aren’t read as code, and instead serve as a way to leave notes about how to do something or why you made a change to the code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Comments can always be deleted without effect to your website (e.g. you can delete the commented lines 1-6 in &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; if you don’t want to always see this info about Jekyll use).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; file according to these instructions:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;title&lt;/strong&gt;: The title of your website, as you want it to appear in the header of the webpage.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt;: Your email address.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;description&lt;/strong&gt;: A description of your website that will be used in search engine results and the site’s RSS feed.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;baseurl&lt;/strong&gt;: Fill in the quotation marks with a forward slash followed by the name of your website folder (e.g. “/JekyllDemo”) to help locate the site at the correct URL.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;url&lt;/strong&gt;: Replace “http://yourdomain.com” with “localhost:4000” to help locate your local version of the site at the correct URL.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;twitter_username&lt;/strong&gt;: Your Twitter username (do not include @ symbol).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;github_username&lt;/strong&gt;: Your GitHub username.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The changes you made to the &lt;em&gt;baseurl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;url&lt;/em&gt; lines will let your site run from the same files both locally on your computer and live on the Web, but &lt;strong&gt;doing this changed the URL where you’ll see your local site from now on&lt;/strong&gt; (while &lt;a href=&quot;#section3-1&quot;&gt;Jekyll is running&lt;/a&gt;) from localhost:4000 to &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/strong&gt; (substitute your website folder name for &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; and remembering the last slash mark).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the screenshot below, I have deleted the initial commented lines 1-6 as well as the commented text stating what “description” does (not necessary, just to show you can delete comments that you don’t care about seeing!) as customized the rest of the file as instructed above:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Save the file, and start (or stop and restart if it’s currently running) the website, then visit &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/strong&gt; (substituting your website folder name for &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; and remembering the last slash mark) to see your customized local site:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-17.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-and-what-is-everything-a-idsection4-2a&quot;&gt;Where (and what) is everything? &lt;a id=&quot;section4-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how your site works and what files you’d experiment with to do more advanced things, here are some notes on what each folder or file in your current website folder does. Remember to always open and edit any files with a text editor (e.g. TextWrangler) and not a word processor (e.g. not Microsoft Word or anything that lets you add formatting like italic and bold); this prevents invisible formatting characters from being saved in the file and messing up the website. If you just want to start adding content to your site and make it public, you can &lt;a href=&quot;#section5&quot;&gt;skip to the next section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-18.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_config.yml&lt;/strong&gt; is discussed &lt;a href=&quot;#section4-1&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;; it provides basic settings information about your site, such as the site’s title and additional possibilities we won’t cover here, like how to structure links to posts (e.g. should they follow the pattern MySite.com/year/month/day/post-title?).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_includes&lt;/strong&gt; folder has files that get included on all or certain pages (e.g. code to make the header contain your site title and main menu on every page of the site)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_layouts&lt;/strong&gt; folder contains code that controls how the pages on your site look (default.html), as well as customizations of that code to further style blog posts (post.html) and pages (page.html)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_posts&lt;/strong&gt; folder holds the individual files that each represent a blog post on your website. Adding a new post to this folder will make a new blog post appear on your website, in reverse chronological order (newest post to oldest). We’ll cover adding blog posts in the &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-2&quot;&gt;next section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_sass&lt;/strong&gt; folder holds SCSS files that control the visual design of the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_site&lt;/strong&gt; folder is where the HTML pages that appear on the web are generated and stored (e.g. you’ll write and save posts as Markdown files, but Jekyll will convert these to HTML for display in a web browser)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;about.md&lt;/strong&gt; is an example of a Jekyll &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt;. It’s already linked in the header of your website, and you can customize its text by opening and writing in that file. We’ll cover adding more site pages in the &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-3&quot;&gt;next section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;css&lt;/strong&gt; folder holds CSS converted from SCSS that controls the visual design of the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;feed.xml&lt;/strong&gt; lets people follow the RSS feed of your blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index.html&lt;/strong&gt; controls the structuring of content on your site’s homepage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-pages-and-posts-a-idsection5a&quot;&gt;Writing pages and posts &lt;a id=&quot;section5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section will describe how to create pages and blog posts on your website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pages&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;posts&lt;/strong&gt; are just two types of written content that’s styled differently. Pages are content (like an “About” page) that isn’t organized or displayed chronologically, but might be included in your website’s main menu; posts are meant to be used for content best organized by publication date. The URLs (links) for pages and posts are also different by default (although you can change this): page URLs look like &lt;em&gt;MySite.com/about/&lt;/em&gt;, while post URLs look like &lt;em&gt;MySite.com/2016/02/29/my-post-title.html.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;authoring-in-markdown-a-idsection5-1a&quot;&gt;Authoring in Markdown &lt;a id=&quot;section5-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a way of formatting your writing for reading on the web: it’s a set of easy-to-remember symbols that show where text formatting should be added (e.g. a # in front of text means to format it as a heading, while a * in front of text means to format it as a bulleted list item). For Jekyll in particular, Markdown means you can write webpages and blog posts in a way that’s comfortable to authors (e.g. no need to look up/add in HTML tags while trying to write an essay), but have that writing show up formatted nicely on the web (i.e. a text-to-HTML convertor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won’t cover Markdown in this lesson; if you’re not familiar with it, for now you can just create posts and pages with no formatting (i.e. no bold/italic, no headers, no bulleted lists). But these are easy to learn how to add: there’s a handy markdown &lt;a href=&quot;http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown&quot;&gt;a Programming Historian lesson by Sarah Simpkin on the hows and whys of writing with Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. Check out these links if you’d like to format text (italics, bold, headings, bullet/numbered lists) or add hyperlinks or embedded images and other files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure any Markdown cheatsheets you look at are for the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html&quot;&gt;kramdown&lt;/a&gt;” flavor of Markdown, which is what GitHub Pages (where we’ll be hosting our website) supports. (&lt;em&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark/wiki/Markdown-Flavors&quot;&gt;various “flavors” of Markdown&lt;/a&gt; that have subtle differences in what various symbols do, but for the most part frequently used symbols like those that create heading formatting are the same—so you’re actually probably okay using a markdown cheatsheet that doesn’t specify it’s kramdown, but if you’re getting errors on your site using symbols that aren’t included in kramdown might be why&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be interested in “markdown editor” software such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typora.io/&quot;&gt;Typora&lt;/a&gt; (OS X and Windows; free during current beta period), which will let you use popular keyboard shortcuts to write Markdown (e.g. highlight text and press command-B to make it bold) and/or type in Markdown but have it show as it will look on the web (see headings styled like headings, instead of like normal text with a # in front of them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;authoring-pages-a-idsection5-3a&quot;&gt;Authoring pages &lt;a id=&quot;section5-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see an existing page on your website (created as a default part of a Jekyll website &lt;a href=&quot;#section3&quot;&gt;when you created the rest of your website’s files&lt;/a&gt;), navigate to your website folder and open the &lt;strong&gt;about.md&lt;/strong&gt; file either in a text editor (e.g. TextWrangler) or a Markdown editor (e.g. Typora) to see the file that creates the “About” page. Also click on the “About” link in the top-right of your webpage to see what the webpage the file creates looks like in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stuff between the -– dashes is called “front matter” (&lt;em&gt;note that opening the file in a Markdown editor might make the front matter appear on a gray background instead of between dashes&lt;/em&gt;). The front matter tells your site whether to format the content below the front matter as a page or blog post, the title of the post, the date and time the post should show it was published, and any categories you’d like the post or page listed under.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can change things in the front matter of a page:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;layout:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep this as-is (it should say page).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;title:&lt;/strong&gt; Change this to the desired page title (unlike posts, no quotation marks around the title). In the screenshot below, I added a page with the title “Resume”.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;permalink:&lt;/strong&gt; change the text between the two forward slash marks to the word (&lt;em&gt;or phrase—but you’ll need to use hyphens and not spaces!&lt;/em&gt;) that you want to follow your site’s main URL to reach the page. For example, &lt;strong&gt;permalink: /about/&lt;/strong&gt; locates a page at &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/yourwebsitefoldername/about/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The space below the front matter’s second — dashes (or below the front matter’s gray box, if using a Markdown editor) is where you write the content of your page, using &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-1&quot;&gt;the Markdown formatting described above&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a new page in addition to the “About” page that already exists on the site (and can be customized or deleted), create a copy of the &lt;em&gt;about.md&lt;/em&gt; file in the same folder (the main website folder) and change its filename to the title you wish, using hyphens instead of spaces (e.g. &lt;em&gt;resume.md&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;contact-me.md&lt;/em&gt;). Also change the title and permalink in the file’s front matter, and the content of the file. The new page should automatically appear in the main menu in the site’s header:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-22.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/resume/&quot;&gt;an example of a page&lt;/a&gt; on my demo site, or see &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandavisconti/JekyllDemo/gh-pages/resume.md&quot;&gt;the file that’s behind that page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;authoring-posts-a-idsection5-2a&quot;&gt;Authoring posts &lt;a id=&quot;section5-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Finder, navigate to your website folder (e.g. &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;) and the &lt;em&gt;_posts&lt;/em&gt; folder inside it. Open the file inside it with either a text editor (e.g. TextWrangler) or a Markdown editor (e.g. Typora). The file will be named something like &lt;em&gt;2016-02-28-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown&lt;/em&gt; (the date will match when you created the Jekyll site).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-19.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As with pages, with posts the stuff between the -– lines is called “front matter” (&lt;em&gt;note that opening the file in a Markdown editor might make the front matter appear on a gray background instead of between dashes&lt;/em&gt;). The front matter tells your site whether to format the content below the front matter as a page or blog post, the title of the post, the date and time the post should show it was published, and any categories you’d like the post or page listed under.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re going to write a second post so you can see how multiple posts look on your site. Close the &lt;em&gt;20xx-xx-xx-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown&lt;/em&gt; file that was open, then right-click on that file in Finder and choose “Duplicate”. A second file named &lt;em&gt;20xx-xx-xx-welcome-to-jekyll copy.markdown&lt;/em&gt; will appear in the _sites folder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click once on the &lt;em&gt;20xx-xx-xx-welcome-to-jekyll copy.markdown&lt;/em&gt; file name so that you can edit the file name, then alter it to show today’s date and contain a different title, such as &lt;em&gt;2016-02-29-a-post-about-my-research.markdown&lt;/em&gt; (use hyphens between words, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; spaces).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now open your renamed file in your text or markdown editor, and customize the following:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;layout:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep this as-is (it should say &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;title:&lt;/strong&gt; Change “Welcome to Jekyll!” to whatever title you’d like for your new post (keeping the quotation marks around the title). It’s the norm to make the title the same as the words in the filename (except with added spaces and capitalization). This is how the title will appear on the post’s webpage).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;date:&lt;/strong&gt; Change this to when you want the post to show as its publication date and time, making sure to match the date that’s part of the filename. (The date &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; time should have occurred already, for your post to show up.)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Delete the words “jekyll update” for now, and don’t add anything else here—the current theme doesn’t use these and they mess up the post URLs. (&lt;em&gt;Other themes can use this field to sort blog posts by categories&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The space below the second -– (or below the gray box, if using a Markdown editor):&lt;/strong&gt; This is where you write your blog post, using &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-1&quot;&gt;the Markdown formatting described above&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After saving, you should now be able to see your second post on the front page of your site, and clicking on the link should take you to the post’s page:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-20.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-21.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;strong&gt;the URL of the post&lt;/strong&gt; is your local website URL (e.g. &lt;em&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/em&gt;) followed by the year/month/date of publication, followed by the title as written in your filename and ending with .html (e.g. &lt;em&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/2016/02/29/a-post-about-my-research.html&lt;/em&gt;). Jekyll is converting the Markdown file you authored in the _posts folder into this HTML webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deleting a file&lt;/strong&gt; from the _posts folder removes it from your website (you can try this with the “Welcome to Jekyll!!” sample post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To create further posts&lt;/strong&gt;, duplicate an existing file, then remember to change not just the front matter and content inside the post as described above, but also the file name (date and title) of the new file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/2016/02/29/a-post-about-my-research.html&quot;&gt;an example of a post&lt;/a&gt; on my demo site, or see &lt;a href=&quot;http://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandavisconti/JekyllDemo/gh-pages/_posts/2016-02-29-a-post-about-my-research.markdown&quot;&gt;the code running that post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hosting-on-github-pages-a-idsection6a&quot;&gt;Hosting on GitHub Pages &lt;a id=&quot;section6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You now know how to add text pages and posts to your website. In this section. we’ll move your local site live so that others can visit it on the Web.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;At this point, we are making a version of your website publicly viewable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(e.g. to search engines and to anyone who knows of or happens on the link).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section1-2&quot;&gt;Earlier in the lesson,&lt;/a&gt; you installed the GitHub Desktop app. We’ll now use this app to easily move your website files to a place that will serve them to visitors as webpages (GitHub Pages), where the public can then visit them online. This first time, we’ll move all your website’s files to the Web since none of them are there yet; in the future, you’ll use this app whenever you’ve adjusted the website’s files (added, edited, or deleted content or files) on your local version of the website and are ready for the same changes to appear on the public website (there’s &lt;a href=&quot;#section6-1&quot;&gt;a cheatsheet at the end of this section&lt;/a&gt; for this).&lt;/em&gt;
1. Open the GitHub Desktop app. Click the &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; icon in the top left corner, and click on the “Add” option along the top of the box that appears (if “Add” isn’t already selected).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on the “Choose…” button and choose the folder (&lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; in my example) containing your website files (if on a Mac and unable to locate this folder, your Library folder may be hidden; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/mavericks-easily-make-user-library-folder-visible&quot;&gt;use these directions&lt;/a&gt; to make it visible so the GitHub Desktop app can look navigate inside it).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, click on the “Create &amp;amp; Add Repository” button (Mac) or the “Create Repository” button (Windows). You’ll now see a list of the files to which you’ve made changes (additions or deletions to and of files) since the last time you copied your website code from your computer to GitHub (&lt;em&gt;in this case, we’ve never copied code to GitHub before, so all files are listed here as new&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first field, type a short description of the changes you’ve made since you last moved your work on the website to GitHub (space is limited). In this first case, something along the lines of “My first commit!” is fine; in the future, you might want to be more descriptive to help you locate when you made a given change—e.g. writing “Added new ‘Contact Me’ page”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can use the larger text area below this to write a longer message, if needed (&lt;em&gt;it’s optional&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-23.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the top of the app window, click on the third icon from the left (it will say “Add a branch” if you hover over it). Type &lt;em&gt;gh-pages&lt;/em&gt; in the “Name” field, then click the “Create branch” button.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-24.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on the “Commit to gh-pages” button near the bottom-left of the app window.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-25.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on the “Publish” button in the top-right.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-26.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the popup, leave everything as-is and click the “Publish repository” button in the lower-right (&lt;em&gt;your window may not show the options related to private repositories shown in the screenshot&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-27.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click the “Sync” button in the upper-right&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-28.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now visit (and share the link to!) your live website. The URL will follow the pattern of &lt;em&gt;your GitHub username DOT github.io SLASH name of your website SLASH&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, the author’s URL is &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/&quot;&gt;amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mini-cheatsheet-a-idsection6-1a&quot;&gt;Mini cheatsheet &lt;a id=&quot;section6-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future when you want to move changes you’ve made locally to your live site, just follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the GitHub Desktop app and type a short description of your changes (and optionally a longer description in the second text box).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the “commit” button underneath the text box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the commit has finished, click the “Sync” button in the top-right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give GitHub a little time to receive these changes (about 10-90 seconds) before refreshing your live site to see your changes there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-fancy-a-idsection7a&quot;&gt;Getting fancy &lt;a id=&quot;section7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This lesson won’t cover advanced work like changing the visual appearance of your site or adding new functionality, but here is some information to get you started on your own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-design-a-idsection7-1a&quot;&gt;Visual design &lt;a id=&quot;section7-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visual design of a website is often referred to as its &lt;em&gt;theme&lt;/em&gt; (more properly, a theme is a set of code and image files that together make a major change to the appearance of a website).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can customize the current theme of your website by making changes to the files in the &lt;em&gt;_sass&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;css&lt;/em&gt; folders (unfortunately, the most recent version of Jekyll’s move to use SASS instead of plain CSS makes learning to customize things a bit more difficult for non-designers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can add in (and further customize, if desired) a theme already created by someone else by searching for “Jekyll themes” or trying one of these resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alex Gil’s “Ed” theme for minimal digital editions (https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/, https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/documentation.html; free)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rebecca Sutton Koeser’s “Digital Edition” theme (https://github.com/emory-libraries-ecds/digitaledition-jekylltheme; free)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/&quot;&gt;Jekyll Themes&lt;/a&gt; directory (free)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.io/&quot;&gt;JekyllThemes.io&lt;/a&gt; (free and paid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;functionality-a-idsection7-2a&quot;&gt;Functionality &lt;a id=&quot;section7-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/&quot;&gt;Jekyll plugins&lt;/a&gt; allow you to add small bits of code that add functionality to your site such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PascalW/jekyll_indextank&quot;&gt;full-text search&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yihangho/emoji-for-jekyll&quot;&gt;emoji support&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/ilkka/710577&quot;&gt;tag clouds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to host your site on GitHub Pages as we did in this lesson, you can only use the Jekyll plugins already included in the GitHub Pages gem we installed (here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/versions/&quot;&gt;a full list of what you installed&lt;/a&gt; when adding the GitHub Pages gem to your Gemfile earlier).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you choose to host your Jekyll website elsewhere than GitHub Pages, you can use any Jekyll plugin (instructions to self-host vary by web host and won’t be covered here, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is a page about how to install plugins once you’ve set up your self-hosted Jekyll site). You can search for “Jekyll plugin” plus the functionality you need to see if one is available, or check out the “Available plugins” section near the bottom of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for a list of plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can keep GitHub Page’s free hosting of your Jekyll website, but give the site a &lt;strong&gt;custom domain name&lt;/strong&gt; (domain names are purchased for a reasonable yearly fee—usually around $10—from a “domain name registrar” such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/services/domains&quot;&gt;NearlyFreeSpeech.net&lt;/a&gt;). For example, the author’s LiteratureGeek.com blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages just like the site you built with this lesson, but it uses a custom domain name I purchased and configured to point to my site. Instructions on setting up a custom domain name can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;migrate an existing blog&lt;/strong&gt; from many other systems including WordPress, Blogger, Drupal, and Tumblr by following the links on the right side of &lt;a href=&quot;https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/home/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. When migrating a site, make sure to back up your original site in case it takes a couple tries to get posts living at the same URL as before (so search engine results and bookmarks don’t break).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cheatsheet-a-idsection8a&quot;&gt;Cheatsheet &lt;a id=&quot;section8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To test stuff locally&lt;/strong&gt; (new plugin, theme, how a new blog post looks):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start local site&lt;/em&gt;: Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt; at the command line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visit local site&lt;/em&gt;: Open &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/yourwebfoldername/&lt;/strong&gt; in a web browser (e.g. &lt;em&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/em&gt;). Don’t forget the trailing slash!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;See changes on the local site as you make them:&lt;/em&gt; While the site is running, after making changes to website files: save the files and refresh the webpage to see the changes—&lt;strong&gt;except for the _config.yml file&lt;/strong&gt;, for which you must stop running the website and restart running the website to see changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stop local site:&lt;/em&gt; Hit &lt;strong&gt;control-c&lt;/strong&gt; on the command line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To move local changes to your live site&lt;/strong&gt; (new post, settings tweak, etc.):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the desired changes to your website’s local files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the GitHub Desktop app, make sure your website is chosen in the left sidebar’s list of repositories, and write your commit message summary (and description if desired).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click “Commit to gh-pages” in the lower left.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After the commit has completed, click “Sync” in the upper right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow 10-90 seconds for your changes to reach GitHub’s web servers, then visit your website and refresh the page to see your changes live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If you’re working on the command line and get an error message, don’t forget to try searching for that specific error message online. Besides search engines, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;the StackExchange site&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to find questions and answers from people who have run into the same problem as you in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Talking social web annotation at the Folger Digital Futures panel</title>
   <link href="/2016/04/11/folger-digital-futures-social-web-annotation"/>
   <updated>2016-04-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/04/11/folger-digital-futures-social-web-annotation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Early modern DH projects have focused on things like transcription, tagging, and data mining of texts; what else can DH projects around Elizabethan plays, old recipe manuscripts, and other early modern content do? I was part of a Folger Shakespeare Library sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/nbrgcxg&quot;&gt;panel on “digital futures”&lt;/a&gt; at the Renaissance Society of American annual conference (4/1/2016) that discussed possible next steps, and I gave a brief talk about the opportunities &lt;strong&gt;social annotation&lt;/strong&gt; on such projects could support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-kind-of-annotation&quot;&gt;What kind of annotation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in letting modern readers add annotations to digital editions and similar textual projects. Where we may be used to pre-publication annotation by textual scholars, I’m interested in post-publication annotation by readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online, this often looks like dragging your cursor to highlight words or sentences and typing in your annotation (with an expanded audience of annotators, this might mean a comment, question, interpretation,contextualization, translation, illustration, locations, or something else…). Then, you can see that annotation plus the annotations of other readers displayed somewhere alongside the digital text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open, public social annotation hasn’t yet been as supported by DH projects as activities like transcription or tagging. Compounding this, I’m not an early modernist, so if anyone knows of early modern projects supporting public annotation, please let me know! You can check out non-early-modern examples in the NYPL’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://candide.nypl.org/text/&quot;&gt;Candide 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, or my own project at &lt;a href=&quot;http://candide.nypl.org/text/&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m especially interested in ways we can open up the conversations around literature to those outside universities, so I’m going to briefly talk about a couple ideas for social web annotation that serve reading audiences such as students and public enthusiasts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personalized--customized-annotated-editions&quot;&gt;Personalized &amp;amp; customized annotated editions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Letting readers and researchers filter the visible annotations on a digital edition to just those matching personal interests and needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we open texts to social annotation, even beyond basic moderation and curation to make sure annotations should be exposed to the public (e.g. that they’re not spam or off-topic…), we’ll quickly get more annotationson any page than most readers or scholars will want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By gathering metadata such as the date the annotation was authored, the subjects the annotation discusses (e.g. slang or religion), and the type of annotation (is it interpretation? a translation? an illustration?), we can begin to allow filtering what annotations are displayed to each reader’s needs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E.g.only show interpretations or contextualizations; don’t show translations; only show feminist readings; only show me annotations written by actors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E.g. a classroom version, first-time reader version, version accompanying a scholarly article annotating specific textual proof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll briefly mention a few other filters provided by social curation of a website’s annotations: voting (problematic!), flagging for usefulness, tagging by annotation affect (funny, thoughtful). These carry their own issues–you want to have readers see ideas that challenge them, and give a voice in the conversation around a text to people who haven’t been invited in the past, so the various ways you make social annotation practically readable are very much under experimentation and debate. It’s important that projects allowing annotation filtering are prepared to test, assess, and change their interface to better support their user communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;annotation-framework-as-an-interactive-introduction-to-textual-scholarship&quot;&gt;Annotation framework as an interactive introduction to textual scholarship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m imagining a kind of “Choose Your Own Edition” website that walks you through various locations of possible editorial intervention on a single interesting textual page, lets you choose from possible interventions or write in your own, and at the end recommends short writings and scholarly editions by editors who both strongly match and strongly oppose your line of reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a very basic level, this makes clear to readers that “editing” is additional things beyond transcription, and that transcription is a complex and critical activity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I wireframed “Choose Your Own Edition” during a seminar at the Folger Shakespeare Library taught by Dr. Jeffrey Masten, and I’m hoping to further prototype the idea in partnership with Dr. Liz Mercier, who has been working on paleography pedagogy through her own site at &lt;a href=&quot;http://purduepaleography.cla.purdue.edu/index.html&quot;&gt;http://purduepaleography.cla.purdue.edu/index.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, different groups of students might be assigned to read the same section of a digital edition, but with a different “editorial theory” filter turned on for each group. Class discussion could then explore how reading differed when supplemented by annotations coming from different schools of thought and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, after annotating scenes in a play, annotators could find out what kind of readings their annotations matched. E.g. did people into certain theories or readings tend to find certain passages especially interesting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see more digital editions in the future simply allowing post-publication social annotation, where annotation of a digital edition is an ongoing activity open to the public (or some subset, such as invited literature scholars), rather than just having finished digital editions containing annotations released to the public. Social annotations can let the conversation around a text grow and be iterative as new ideas, new performances, and new relevant events occur. Annotations can increase public interest in illustrative materials and lesser known texts. And perhaps most importantly, annotation can support participation and inclusion of citizen humanists.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Making it public (a Knight Foundation News Challenge proposal)</title>

   <updated>2016-03-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/03/24/making-it-public-knight-foundation-news-challenge</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Humanities research and publication should be more than just writing and printing polished monographs. I envision a humanities where born-digital publication lets us document and celebrate the entire research spectrum, with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; critical work (teaching, learning, discovery…) by&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; on campus interested in the humanities (students, staff, faculty at all levels…) using&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; methods for critical thinking (writing, coding, curating, annotating, visualizing…) and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; forms of “making public” (ebooks, blogs, interactive websites, code libraries, datasets…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…realized and made public through a university’s libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KnightVideoSlide.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To realize this vision, I recently submitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/how-might-libraries-serve-21st-century-information-needs/submissions/making-it-public-a-more-public-humanities-by-co-evolving-the-digital-humanities-center-university-press&quot;&gt;a proposal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newschallenge.org/&quot;&gt;Knight Foundation’s News Challenge&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the Purdue University Press Director &amp;amp; Head of Scholarly Publishing Peter Froelich. The New Challenge will fund answers to the question “&lt;em&gt;How might libraries serve 21st century information needs&lt;/em&gt;?” (You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/how-might-libraries-serve-21st-century-information-needs/submissions/making-it-public-a-more-public-humanities-by-co-evolving-the-digital-humanities-center-university-press&quot;&gt;comment on our proposal here&lt;/a&gt;—proposals are currently undergoing public review, commentary, and updating.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/159821316?byline=0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/159821316&quot;&gt;Making it public: a more public humanities by co-evolving the digital humanities center &amp;amp; university press&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/user8389727&quot;&gt;LiteratureGeek&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-description&quot;&gt;Project description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pursue this goal through a collaboration of two Purdue Libraries units: the Digital Humanities Center and University Press. This proposal would fund a “co-evolving” of these partners towards a sustainable workflow for libraries to make all kinds of humanities work truly publicly accessible, welcoming, and participatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funds would support the Digital Humanities Center and Press using the coming year to focus on creating and testing best practices documents and workflows for humanities publication issues such as technical longterm sustainability, ethical crediting of project effort, and contracts that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;outline and support generative collaborations among the Libraries and diverse campus humanities researchers. This work would include the development of a physical space dedicated to experimental, collaborative, public digital humanities building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several test case research projects involving a variety of campus roles, research areas, methods, and publication forms would be pursued and fully publicly documented. These example projects would focus on several areas of humanities endeavor with broad impacts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;works aimed at broader, public audiences (the humanities as radically relevant and inviting)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;works supporting public interaction with and participation with research and learning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;works throughout the life cycle of research (not just polished monographs, but mid-state publishing during a project, blogging, dataset publication, digital dissertations…)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;broadly reusable work documenting research practices, workflows, and infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project deliverables are both the published, born-digital humanities publication that the collaboration will support, and the publicly documented model of co-evolving a digital humanities center and university press to make a campus’ humanities research radically more 
public (made available both as blogs on successes, failures, and experiments during the collaboration, and as a whitepaper after one year of collaboration). Finally, we’ll host a THATCamp unconference on “making the humanities public” at the end of the year, which will allow 
others interested in these goals to meet, exchange ideas, and plan future collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-this-project-advance-the-library-field&quot;&gt;How does this project advance the library field?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project explores a co-evolution of two areas of the library currently undergoing rapid digital changes, supporting university press born-digital publishing and digital humanities exploration. The project will both deliver real born-digital digital humanities publications, and also document and publicly share the model (workflows, best practices, failures, successes…) we use to achieve those publications. By creating regular blog posts on successes, failures, and experiments during the collaboration, and a whitepaper after one year of collaboration, we aim to thoroughly make public this project about making the humanities public, allowing other libraries to build off what we learn and use our collaboration as a model for jumpstarting their own partnerships toward a more public humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-the-audience-and-what-are-their-information-needs&quot;&gt;Who is the audience and what are their information needs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad humanities community at Purdue—especially those not traditionally enfranchised to experiment and publish their work—will benefit directly from the collaborative model explored by this project: undergraduate and graduate students in the College of Liberal Arts and School of Interdisciplinary Studies, department and Libraries staff, and faculty at all levels of contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the international humanities community can benefit from the public documentation of this project’s evolution, and citizen humanists will benefit from the creation of humanities publications aimed at inviting, welcoming, teaching, and learning with this under-served audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;team-members--their-qualifications&quot;&gt;Team members &amp;amp; their qualifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will be led by two units based in the Purdue University Libraries: the Digital Humanities Center and the University Press &amp;amp; Scholarly Publishing Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amanda Visconti, an Assistant Professor and the Digital Humanities Specialist in the Libraries, directs the Digital Humanities Center. Her background includes work at diverse digital humanities (DH) centers, including at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities in a variety of roles (2009-2015). She holds a literature Ph.D. and information master’s both focused on DH, and offers almost a decade of experience as a professional DH web developer. An active member of the DH community, Visconti was elected to the ACH executive council (2016-2020), runs a popular DH research blog (http://LiteratureGeek.com), and recently completed a wholly digital humanities dissertation with a central project (http://InfiniteUlysses.com) that has drawn over 20,000 unique visitors in its first year. Her unique mix of coding and design experience coupled with digital humanities scholarship supports this project’s creations of sustainable, ethical technical workflows for born-digital humanities publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Froehlich is the Director of the Purdue University Press and head of Scholarly Publishing Services at Purdue University Libraries. He brings to this project wide-ranging experience in the publishing world and a dedicated interest in innovating through born-digital publication. Froelich worked 2006-2010 at the Indiana University Press, and holds a B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley and an MBA from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Better tech via annotation (using Hypothesis to improve your technical documentation, code, and tutorials)</title>
   <link href="/2016/03/22/better-tech-via-annotation-hypothesis-documentation-code-tutorials"/>
   <updated>2016-03-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/03/22/better-tech-via-annotation-hypothesis-documentation-code-tutorials</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece originally appeared as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/blog/better-tech-via-annotation/&quot;&gt;a guest post on the Hypothes.is blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis makes inline annotation on any web resource possible: a visually small change from comment sections at the end of resources, but a change with a big impact. Whatever your relationship to tech, we’ve all been here: you’re reading through some technical resource (code, documentation, or tutorial) and something doesn’t work the way the page says it should. Maybe you want to add details or a better example; maybe you run into an error message or have a questions specific to your circumstances. Maybe you just want to let the author know “you lost me here”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tech resources where understanding succeeds or fails line-by-line instead of by paragraph or section, inline annotation—the ability to highlight specific text and discuss it right next to where it occurs—is a vast improvement. Even those resources with comment sections at the bottom have problems specific to that positioning, like low-quality comments stemming from commentators not responding to any actual statement on the page, or having trouble identifying where a tutorial lost them. In this post, I’ll cover how a community used Hypothesis to improve a technical resource: how we got our users involved, the types of annotations we observed, and how we’re working to automate the workflow from a new annotation to an improved tech resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-community-annotates&quot;&gt;A community annotates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a member of the digital humanities (DH) community—we’re builders, users, teachers, and thinkers around innovative digital tools for literature, history, and other cultural heritage fields (stuff like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/uncategorized/preserving-reconstructing-teaching-in-3d/&quot;&gt;3D printing for archaeology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://viraltexts.org/&quot;&gt;text analysis of historical memes in newspapers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;interfaces that let readers interpret and discuss challenging novels&lt;/a&gt;). During the first two weeks in February, &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricarchaeology.ca/about/&quot;&gt;Shawn Graham&lt;/a&gt; and I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/dhannotates&quot;&gt;#DHannotates&lt;/a&gt; tag to encourage DHers to switch from passively reading tech resources to actively annotating them via Hypothesis. We focused on one resource: the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;Programming Historian site&lt;/a&gt;, where novice-friendly lessons on DH tech skills like the following are &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/project-team&quot;&gt;authored, edited, and peer-reviewed by community volunteers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/cleaning-ocrd-text-with-regular-expressions&quot;&gt;Cleaning OCR’d [scanned and digitized] text with regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;, by Laura Turner O’Hara&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet&quot;&gt;Getting started with topic modeling and MALLET&lt;/a&gt;, by Shawn Graham, Scott Weingart, and Ian Milligan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources&quot;&gt;Visualizing historical networks&lt;/a&gt;, by Marten Düring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/corpus-analysis-with-antconc&quot;&gt;Corpus analysis with Antconc&lt;/a&gt;, by Heather Froehlich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Links to all Hypothesis-augmented versions of all the Programming Historian tutorials &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/amandavisconti/89edd34f998c35705409&quot;&gt;can be perused here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’d like developers to leave comments as they work through your documentation or code. Or maybe you want to support a wider user community. Questions during a tutorial? Ideas for improvements? Get stuck? Want to thank the tutorial’s writers and editors? Users can use Hypothesis annotation to add their thoughts and discuss a resource right in its margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;invite-your-users-to-interact-with-your-code-documentation-or-tutorials&quot;&gt;Invite your users to interact with your code, documentation, or tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to see the kinds of questions and suggestions for improvement Hypothesis enables your users to share? Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&quot;&gt;#DHannotates&lt;/a&gt; event drew annotations on tech tutorials such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/a/AVKjiwTOvTW_3w8LyrtI&quot;&gt;Short tips to avoid problems later in the tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/a/AVLRKEnQvTW_3w8Ly4k7&quot;&gt;Further examples of how you can customize a command&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/a/AVKjrSUbvTW_3w8Lyryw&quot;&gt;On tutorials written from a Mac/Linux perspective, notes on what Windows users should do differently&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/a/AVLH3b1vvTW_3w8Ly17O&quot;&gt;Aggregated reports of error messages encountered while following a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; (the more annotations from stymied users, the more an issue might be broadly affecting your community)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/a/AVK7W2hnvTW_3w8Lyx3i&quot;&gt;Request for definitions for abbreviations used in the tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/182#issuecomment-183466725&quot;&gt;see a full list here&lt;/a&gt; of the types of feedback &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/dhannotates&quot;&gt;#DHannotates&lt;/a&gt; garnered on &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/&quot;&gt;the Programming Historian tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-get-my-user-community-interested&quot;&gt;How do I get my user community interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stir up interest, we invited users of a specific resource (&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/&quot;&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;) from a specific user community (digital humanities) using Twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/dhannotates&quot;&gt;#DHannotates hashtag&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Slack&lt;/a&gt;. Two tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep the initial focus of your encouragement narrowed to a specific webpage or set of related resources.&lt;/em&gt; We’d love the DH community to annotate all our tech resources, but we decided to start with focus on just one website to keep involvement simple.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encourage people to try annotations &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt; by making it clear their thoughts will be read and responded to during the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Users may be more excited to immediately try out a specific experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Come learn markdown basics from &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;! And we’ll answer any issues you run into if you annotate the lesson this week.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then to remember there’s a new annotation tool to use, the next time they’re using your documentation or lessons and run into something they wish they could discuss. Tying annotation into involvement is a great way to attract and include new users in your tech resource’s community, too—annotation is a form of contributing that even those with little experience in your programming language can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis makes getting started annotating easy. The instructions we shared were simple enough to fit in a tweet or two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypothes.is/register&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create a Hypothesis account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prefix the URL of the webpage you want to annotate with https://via.hypothes.is/.&lt;/em&gt; That is, cut and paste that in front of the link to the page you want to annotate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annotate!&lt;/em&gt; It’s very intuitive: highlight the text you want to talk about using your mouse cursor, and then type in your comment or question. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/&quot;&gt;Hypothesis’ tutorial for student annotators&lt;/a&gt; for specific steps and pictures that show you everything you can do with annotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also published blog posts on the project for those who wanted &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&quot;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; or were interested from the standpoint of &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricarchaeology.ca/2016/02/02/can-we-fix-it-yes-we-can/&quot;&gt;a teacher seeking to support student tech learning in the classroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-someone-annotates-does-anyone-else-know&quot;&gt;If someone annotates, does anyone else know?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For #DHannotates, we encouraged annotation adoption by promising to answer questions during the weeks of the event—or if we couldn’t answer a question, we’d at least make sure the issue was recorded where a future volunteer could address it. Tactics for this included creating an issue in the Programming Historian GitHub repo, and trying to find people who can answer questions via Twitter and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inline highlighting made this much simpler than responding to a comments section at the end of each lesson. By focusing on a set of specific experiences (e.g. “Now’s the time to learn basic regular expressions and get feedback on any questions as you learn”), potential annotators were encouraged to make the step over the threshold into annotation as a habit, creating a Hypothesis user account and starting to read a new tech lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great thing about Hypothesis annotations is that annotations are helpful as-is. In cases such as users providing very specific use cases, further information for the curious, or thanks to the authors of a tutorial, some annotations can simply live in the Hypothesis sidebar. For other annotations that suggest a needed change, like reports of error messages or the need to update a tutorial for the latest version of Python, you may want to go further…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automate-annotations--improvements&quot;&gt;Automate annotations =&amp;gt; improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start getting annotations on your documentation or tutorials, you’ll want a workflow to capture and build on this community input. While there isn’t yet an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; Hypothesis channel, you can easily automate managing annotations using a feed. Hypothesis lets you follow RSS or Atom feeds of your annotations in two ways (just switch out the .rss for .atom if using the latter):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A stream of all annotations with a given tag (https://hypothes.is/stream.rss?tags=DHannotates)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A stream per annotated URL (e.g. https://hypothes.is/stream.rss?uri=http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-the-zotero-api)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow the latest annotations through your RSS reader, use a Slack RSS integration to post new annotations to a dedicated Slack channel, or create an issue for each new annotation in your GitHub issue queue to make sure the annotation gets looked at. If you’re concerned about cluttering your issues queue, check out the discussion of tactics among the Programming Historian and #DHannotates group happening on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/182&quot;&gt;this GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in trying Hypothesis with your own tech resource? Ideas, questions, and suggestions related to using Hypothesis to improve tech resources can be shared using the Hypothesis (&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hypothesis-forum&quot;&gt;general product&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hypothesis-users&quot;&gt;users forums&lt;/a&gt;), or by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues&quot;&gt;adding a GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Peer review for my Programming Historian lesson on Jekyll+GitHub Pages website creation</title>
   <link href="/2016/03/15/peer-review-programming-historian-jekyll"/>
   <updated>2016-03-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/03/15/peer-review-programming-historian-jekyll</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently submitted a new digital humanities work for peer review: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;” at the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. My lesson teaches you how to create and publish your own basic website or blog (which will look &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/&quot;&gt;just like this&lt;/a&gt; and be publicly accessible on the Web, for free!) using some popular tech (the Jekyll static site generator, and GitHub Pages for web hosting). The lesson attempts to walk you slowly through the process and not assume any previous tech knowledge, and explains why you might be interested in creating a website this way instead of using other tools. (&lt;em&gt;For what it’s worth, this blog you’re reading right now is run using the same tech as the lesson introduces—Jekyll and GitHub Pages!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I invite anyone interested in trying my lesson to share your thoughts as you follow the lesson.&lt;/strong&gt; Everything from ideas of things to add or highlighting parts of the lesson you liked, to “I got stuck here!”, “This sentence was confusing”, “I wish you’d explain why this step is necessary”, and “I understood this step, but I think someone with less of a tech background would be confused” is useful to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange for providing feedback on my lesson as you work through the lesson, during the next month (&lt;em&gt;through April 15, 2016&lt;/em&gt;) I will respond to any comments or questions from lesson users and &lt;strong&gt;I will personally try to make sure you can make it through the whole lesson&lt;/strong&gt; all the way to your own basic public website. (&lt;em&gt;Note: this lesson was originally Mac-only, but I just added and tested steps that should support Windows users as well. I haven’t coded on a PC in years, though, so I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to troubleshoot all Windows-specific issues&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-starting-the-lesson-two-alerts&quot;&gt;Before starting the lesson, two alerts:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will need a Mac computer with a decent internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the early steps of the lesson (&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#section2&quot;&gt;“Xcode” in the “Installing dependencies” section&lt;/a&gt;) requires you to download a piece of Mac developer software that &lt;strong&gt;may take 3-5 hours to download&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll want to budget separate times (30-60 minutes, then 60-120 minutes?) to start the lesson, then come back after that download completes and do the rest of the lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ways-of-sharing-your-feedback&quot;&gt;Ways of sharing your feedback:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email:&lt;/strong&gt; You can email &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; a list of your comments (maybe open the new email and add to it as you go through the lesson?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis annotation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;Follow this special link to my lesson&lt;/a&gt; (it’s the lesson link, prefixed with via.hypothes.is/) to add your feedback right to the lesson! You’ll need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypothes.is/register&quot;&gt;create a Hypothesis account&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have one (or log in), then highlight any words or sentence you want to comment on and type in your annotation (more info on why using Hypothesis annotation is awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&quot;&gt;back in this post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re comfortable with GitHub, you can visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/issues/3&quot;&gt;the peer review ticket for my lesson&lt;/a&gt; and leave your feedback as a comment on that issue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack:&lt;/strong&gt; Slack is a tool for online group chat; you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;join over 400 digital humanists on the Digital Humanities Slack via this link&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to checking out all the “channels” (chatrooms dedicated to discussing specific topics, like annotation and DH teaching), we can use Slack to chat in real-time as you work through the lesson (e.g. send me a direct message). If this is interesting you but you’re not familiar with Slack, let me know and I’m happy to show you how to get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always privately contact my PH editor &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#102;&amp;#119;&amp;#103;&amp;#105;&amp;#098;&amp;#098;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;Fred Gibbs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; by email with questions about the lesson or the peer review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-of-feedback-needed&quot;&gt;Type of feedback needed:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m seeking constructive comments—things that can help me make the lesson better and more accessible to users without a technical background. This includes places where you were confused, got stuck, quit, wanted more details, etc. I’m interested in both how I can make the lesson better for &lt;em&gt;you specifically&lt;/em&gt;, and how you think I could improve the lesson for other users (especially those who may not have as much digital experience as you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/reviewer-guidelines&quot;&gt;reviewer guidelines&lt;/a&gt; with more information about how to be a good, friendly reviewer and how their peer review process works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-programming-historian&quot;&gt;What’s the Programming Historian?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt; is a collaborative web project offering “novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research”. PH features “lessons” written by digital humanists; each lesson is a thorough, novice-friendly walk-through of not just how to use a specific digital humanities tool, but &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you might want to. As such, they’re not classroom lesson plans (though they can be used as part of one!), but rather a pedagogical form of research writing where the new knowledge produced by the writer is all about making a methodology accessible to new users. (&lt;em&gt;That’s how I’m explaining this work to my faculty review committee, by the way.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in finding out more about digital ways of engaging with the humanities, check out the &lt;em&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt;’s list of peer-reviewed lessons &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (they aren’t just for historians, by the way). They’re all fantastic lessons, and run the range from more foundational concepts like &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/preserving-your-research-data&quot;&gt;preserving research data&lt;/a&gt; (by James Baker) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/cleaning-ocrd-text-with-regular-expressions&quot;&gt;cleaning up digital text scanned from print books&lt;/a&gt; (by Laura Turner O’Hara), to methods of distant reading or a full set of lessons on learning the coding language Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially recommend Miriam Posner’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka&quot;&gt;Up and Running with Omeka.net&lt;/a&gt;” (if you’d like to create a website to show off a collection of digital or physical artifacts, like stuff from an archival collection or museum) or Matthew Lincoln’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/graph-databases-and-SPARQL&quot;&gt;Using SPARQL to access Linked Open Data&lt;/a&gt;” (if you keep hearing about how collections like “the &lt;a href=&quot;http://collection.britishmuseum.org&quot;&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.europeana.eu/api/linked-open-data-introduction&quot;&gt;Europeana&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americanart.si.edu&quot;&gt;Smithsonian American Art Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://britishart.yale.edu/collections/using-collections/technology/linked-open-data&quot;&gt;Yale Center forBritish Art&lt;/a&gt;” are publishing “APIs” or “linked open data” and want to know how this might be useful in your research/teaching).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Service +/- collaboration for digital humanities in the library (a DH job talk)</title>
   <link href="/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk"/>
   <updated>2016-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/02/28/service-collaboration-for-digital-humanities-libraries-job-talk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s the job talk I gave in July 2015 for my present role as a digital humanities assistant professor (aka “Digital Humanities Specialist” aka librarian faculty) in the Purdue Libraries (&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/DigitalHumanitiesSpecialist.pdf&quot;&gt;link to the original job ad&lt;/a&gt;). I’m hoping this can help other job seekers, so I’ve only very lightly edited this (all cited sources are gathered in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/dhlibraries&quot;&gt;a Zotero bibliography&lt;/a&gt;). The requested presentation topic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Digital humanities and the research library:&lt;/strong&gt; opportunities and challenges for academic libraries and librarians. Draw upon your experience and knowledge as well as citing research literature in library/archival/information science, and/or disciplinary literature relating to digital humanities.” (Audience: Libraries staff and faculty)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot’s been said about DH +/- Libraries, by people who have had their head in that particular space longer than me (between my information master’s degree and now, my head was in DH from the angle of a literature PhD student and web developer). So instead of rehashing others’ thoughts, I put together &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/dhlibraries&quot;&gt;a Zotero bibliography of some of these recent discussions&lt;/a&gt; and pointed listeners wanting to know more to that link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working in four roles at MITH 2009-2015, consulting and events at various other DH centers, and different levels of involvement on roughly 40 DH projects, I have strong feelings about the kinds of DH relationships and infrastructures that do and don’t work out per situation. I was wary of the “Lone DHer” positions I’ve seen advertised at some institutions, tasking too much on one person; many places want one person to do it all without clear freedom and support to do very much (see the Library Loon’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gavialib.com/2011/12/the-c-word/&quot;&gt;post on “coordinator syndrome”&lt;/a&gt;). Or they require a new DH hire to have a research background, but don’t continue to support that kind of person with contractual personal research time, a tenure or promotion track, or other ways of continuing research and professionalization inside a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t sound like Purdue Libraries wanted that (for one thing, it’s a tenure-track position without a teaching load), but if I was wrong I wanted to know up front. So: I made my job talk about why this new DH role needed to be about creating and growing collaborations, rather than a purely service role—and since Purdue Libraries was already in enthusiastic agreement with this model, I’m working here today! (For what it’s worth, the first comment after my talk was from our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2016/02/james-l-mullins-wins-2016-hugh-c-atkinson-memorial-award&quot;&gt;ALA-award-winning&lt;/a&gt; Dean of Libraries James Mullins, encouraging me to move even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; towards collaboration on the spectrum from service to collaboration I’d described—which was what I also thought best, but I hadn’t wanted to get my hopes up too high… so see my note in the talk adjusting my expectations for the role for an even better reality. Go Purdue Libraries!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.001.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.001&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;service---collaboration-for-digital-humanities-in-the-library&quot;&gt;Service +/- collaboration for digital humanities in the library&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to start a discussion about DH in the library today, but: there are already many recent voices defining what the digital humanities (or DH) is, what a library does, and exactly how much DH and libraries overlap as academic fields. I didn’t want to rehash those debates, so I put together an online Zotero bibliography with bunch of pertinent readings, which you can access via &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/dhlibraries&quot;&gt;tinyurl.com/dhlibraries&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll also be able to find any work I cite in this talk there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.002.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.002&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling together over fifty works defining DH and libraries, and strategizing this combination, wasn’t difficult. It was harder to find &lt;em&gt;case studies&lt;/em&gt; of the specific, day-to-day &lt;em&gt;tactics&lt;/em&gt; of successful combinations of DH and libraries. So, in wanting to discuss the specific question of DH library &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt; today, I’ll try to give some specific examples, spoken and on screen, of the types of events, workflows, and services I’m envisioning. I’d like to focus on what both the strategy and the &lt;em&gt;tactics&lt;/em&gt; of a user-focused service ethic look like, when combined with 1) the digital humanities commitment to collaboration, and 2) recognizing scholarship in all areas of professional practice. I’ll be talking for around 15 minutes, after which we’ll have a lot of time for discussion. &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.004.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.004&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purdue has the collections and staff expertise to support DH and digital scholarship, and is already doing so at an award-winning level (&lt;em&gt;worth a future blog post, but see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2015/01/2015-acrl-excellence-academic-libraries-award-winners-announced&quot;&gt;the Purdue Libraries winning a 2015 ACRL award&lt;/a&gt;, the History Department’s Dr. Kim Gallon’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackpressresearchcollective.org/&quot;&gt;DH research on the black press&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nehspaceandplaceblstinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;upcoming co-running of an NEH ODH Advanced Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and Purdue Libraries’ dedicated Libraries IT unit plus further units focusing on digital work like digitization and repository building&lt;/em&gt;). From my outsider’s view, what I see a DH Specialist providing here is a bridge, a translator, and an advocate: &lt;strong&gt;someone whose mission is specifically 100% focused on creating and strengthening relationships among library users and the thinking, projects, methods, and platforms of digital humanities and related work&lt;/strong&gt;. To better discuss what a DH Specialist could do in the Purdue Libraries, I’ll first highlight what I see as some key features of the digital humanities as a field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital humanities uses digital tools and methods to research, teach, and learn in the humanities. Beyond this basic definition, though, many see DH as a community of relationships, where research is publicly discussed and debated from the beginning of a project onward, from Twitter conversations and public Google Hangouts, through “mid-state” review and requests for feedback on blog posts and early drafts of books, with those books eventually to be published both in print and in open-access digital versions as with volumes in the &lt;em&gt;Debates in DH&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.006.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.006&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With projects attracting peer feedback from diverse fields and professions, the digital humanities is necessarily interdisciplinary in content and method, and highly collaborative. This means that team authorship of scholarly work is more and more supported and encouraged. As you can see onscreen, unlike some non-DH humanities conferences, Scott Weingart’s analysis of recent ADHO Digital Humanities conferences suggests there’s no penalty—and possibly a benefit—to pursuing collaborative work over solo projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public, community-authored statements, like the NEH-funded Collaborators’ Bill of Rights and the more recent UCLA Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights, show DH practitioners striving to support every person involved in scholarly collaborative work through full and correct credit and attribution, regardless of academic rank or the kind of work someone contributed. Reading through the grant opportunities offered by the NEH’s Office of Digital Humanities also shows a preference to fund collaborative efforts that impact the wider scholarly community, pedagogy, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.008.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.008&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, digital humanists care about and support collaboration and diverse collaborators. But lately, a number of respected DH scholars including Bethany Nowviskie, Trevor Munoz, and Miriam Posner have spoken against &lt;em&gt;DH in the library as a service&lt;/em&gt;, arguing that thriving, longterm, widely impactful projects can be hampered by an approach to service that looks like a kind of IT service shop. This is, of course, a delicate topic for many library DHers, because many  (including myself) use the word “service” to embody one of the things that we love most about the work we do: reaching, helping, and teaching others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.009.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.009&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Death by a bounty of Firebug-authored LibGuide tabs…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miriam Posner argues: “Many of the problems we have experienced ‘supporting’ digital humanities work, may stem from the fact that digital humanities projects in general do not need supporters — they need collaborators.” &lt;strong&gt;I’ve found that statements that appear to be “anti-support” or “anti-service” at first glance are, however, actually deeply pro-service—it’s a question of semantics.&lt;/strong&gt; The pushback against the word “service” is an attempt to parse the flow of faculty library-support needs, into on one hand—one-time support that can already be well met by campus academic IT units—and on the other hand, research that calls for deeper applied scholarly expertise and commitment to developing interpersonal scholarly relationships over the longterm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital humanities methods and output are so bound up in each other, that most DH involvement requires some scholarly interest and commitment regardless of whether you’re outlining a research question or building a database for a DH project. The “digital humanities” as a field &lt;strong&gt;isn’t&lt;/strong&gt; so much the &lt;em&gt;digitized&lt;/em&gt; humanities—things like putting up a simple website about your print book—so much as it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; rather often defined by the inclusion of and critical thought about scholarly digital methods and tools in your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital humanities is inherently meta, with an interest in thinking critically &lt;em&gt;about the tools used&lt;/em&gt; being part of the interest in the question itself. Digital humanists often interrogate not just the topic of their research, but also the methods and forms used to reach their scholarly conclusions; we think about the subjectivity and inherent bias of the digital tools and coding languages we apply to a research problem. (&lt;em&gt;Addition: I now focus my DH definition on several perceived+ideal community values, including foremost the making &amp;amp; sharing of new knowledge, whether that looks like a journal article, publicly documenting the best scanner calibrations to capture certain historical book materials, or sharing about a new way of incorporating making/thinking about the digital in the classroom. More in a future post, but this has helped set expectations for my role and separate my work from related ideas like digitization and digital pedagogy (which are DH, but aren’t the goal of my position, or daily services offered by my role).&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.011.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.011&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely believe longtime library core values like our user-focused service ethic should and do hold true in library DH, although sometimes the tactics with which we realize these values may radically change to fit current user needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are two scenarios—both showing a good library service ethic, but with only the latter showing a service ethic that recognizes how digital humanities projects can best come into being, thrive, and give back to users on campus and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In scenario A&lt;/strong&gt;, an English professor drops a print book off at the library…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.012.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.012&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and gets a digital file containing the OCR’d text back promptly via email. End of interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Scenario B&lt;/strong&gt;, an English professor drops off a print book they want digitized to &lt;strong&gt;the DH Specialist&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.013.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.013&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH Specialist asks questions like: why do they want the book digitized? Perhaps the faculty member wants to get a word count for how many times the word “Modernism” is mentioned in the book, and where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.014.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.014&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH Specialist can then format and clean the file appropriately for how it will be used, and return it to the professor. (&lt;em&gt;Actually, this isn’t what happens: I don’t offer digitization or data curation services, and I don’t do one-off work like this that doesn’t forward the mission of the Libraries. See note below…&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.015.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.015&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And… the DH Specialist can also suggest more powerful tools, than a simple word cloud, for looking at word frequency and placement. The DH Specialist may demonstrate how related tactics like topic modeling, could open further research. The professor, in turn, might describe how existing tools don’t quite fit her data or research question, and the DH Specialist might be able to code a patch or plugin, to make the tool better support the professor’s work and future work like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.016.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.016&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Specialist might then mentor the professor in learning topic modeling, if the professor desires, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the Specialist might do some topic modeling, &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the professor, while helping the professor to a good general understanding of the process involved, so that the professor can understand and build on the resulting models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.017.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.017&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the professor and the DH Specialist later co-teach a class, combining literary theory and hands-on work, with the students learning to use digital tools as part of literary research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.018.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then maybe this course results in undergrads or grad students, interested in DH, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with the tech skill training to help out that professor in future research—a new or related project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.019.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.019&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, some of the students might get interested enough to attend further DH training workshops, and eventually consult with the DH Specialist toward designing a digital dissertation their department recognizes as appropriate scholarship. In this second scenario, there’s a cascade of collaboration, a back-and-forth of mutual learning and scholarship that creates a foundation for future projects and teaching opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not in my job talk, but some info about how I’m shaping the job:&lt;/strong&gt; Since I began working at Purdue in August, &lt;u&gt;I realized this second scenario is flawed&lt;/u&gt;—instead of taking the book and processing it, I’d direct the individual to possible resources on and off campus for accomplishing their goal, and then hold a consultation session looking for possible collaboration opportunities as well as needs a future DH center could help support. &lt;strong&gt;I can’t better the DH community on campus by doing one-on-one service work, or using all my time to support and reach just a few faculty members&lt;/strong&gt;: instead, I’m balancing two types of activity:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;1) Being available with an open ear for DH consultations for anyone in our campus community (and actively working so not just faculty but adjuncts, students, and staff know I’m available for their needs). Consultations include emailed followups with links to tutorials, readings, etc. and may turn into future collaborations with me (e.g. co-PI’ing grant projects, developing an academic certificate program) as well as additions to a public directory of available DH collaborators on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;2) Devoting the bulk of my time to building a campus infrastructure to bring together existing and future DH: growing the diverse skills that will let DH widely improve campus research and learning, creating a community of experts who can train one another, and extending both institutional memory and future momentum for DH on campus (with DH consultations helping me survey needs and research toward a future DH space)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back to the job talk!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.020.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.020&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The careful attitude around the word “service” we sometimes see in the digital humanities springs mostly from economy: given the time the DH Specialist has in a week, matching up the support someone on campus needs to the right service provider can help balance a DH Specialist’s time so that the number of people on campus supported—and supported well—is maximized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Library DHers encourage interaction and collaboration as an investment in people. Bethany Nowviskie challenges a service model she describes as “librarians striving to not distract the researcher from his or her work”. &lt;strong&gt;Nowviskie argues that we need to spend as much effort building up relationships among people on campus, as among tools and platforms—surfacing and explaining tacit library knowledges, rather than effacing them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.021.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.021&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked since 2009 in various roles at a thriving, library-based DH center, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu&quot;&gt;Maryland Institute of Technology in the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;, (or “MITH”), on a wide variety of projects (logos for some of these projects are on the screen). I’ve had the chance to experience a spectrum of approaches to DH service in the library, from sometimes more service-style DH website and tool creation, moving over the years to largely focus on collaboration and growing campus relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MITH in particular has honed their model for faculty fellowships so that faculty are highly engaged in the digital pieces of their projects. These engaged faculty were keen to gain some agency in the DH process by having at least a high-level overview of the tech involved, or sometimes learning a coding language; they then became ambassadors for the digital humanities back in their own departments. MITH moved from emphasizing projects to emphasizing collaborations: by nurturing members of the campus digital humanities community, good projects and research followed, and the net worth to the campus community was maximized. One testament to the success of this trend at MITH is that they recently received a 1.5 million dollar Mellon grant to pursue &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; collaborative DH &amp;amp; African-American Studies work, &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; incorporating research from multiple academic departments, students, faculty, staff, and post-docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.023.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.023&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MITH has even improved on their successful model of more engaged fellowships through a series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/research/digital-humanities-incubator-2012-13/&quot;&gt;“DH Incubator” workshops&lt;/a&gt; led by Trevor Munoz and Jennifer Guiliano. These workshops took place throughout a term and were open to any library faculty curious about DH (workshops for other types of researcher, such as last year’s workshops on research with social media, drew attendees from across campus including non-humanities departments). In the first of these incubator workshops, librarians learn foundational DH concepts and approaches, and at the end of the term, those who want to go on and try a DH project, pitch one in front of the group. MITH then picked among these pitches when choosing who to support for its next round of library faculty fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.024.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incubator model serves a couple purposes: librarians across the library become ambassadors for DH, and gain some new tools for their scholarship. Also, the DH center takes on some new projects, from library staff who are already daily saturated in the collection they’re hoping to digitally work with. 
These workshops are team-taught and very hands-on, so the workshops &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;, model how to be the kind of collaborator, who’s a valued member of a DH project team. This incubator model could work well for faculty outside the library too. A DH incubator for &lt;em&gt;students&lt;/em&gt;, could teach the skills of working in a small and interdisciplinary team, that humanities students often don’t get much of a chance to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.026.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.026&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DH &lt;em&gt;collaborations as service&lt;/em&gt; aren’t moving away from the Libraries’ user focus, but rather opening the door for longer and better scholarly relationships, among librarian and students, faculty, and staff. Collaboration lets us serve the campus more widely by offering different levels of collaborative service, from informal consultations through full, grant-funded project collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what does this collaboration-as-service look like on the day-to-day level? The DH Specialist can provide consultations modeled on library reference interviews, where instead of helping the researcher answer a question, the Specialist gives them the tools and map to not only answer their own question efficiently, but to go on to pursue related research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.027.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.027&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Image from DC Comics PSA by Jack Schiff, in&lt;/em&gt; Superman &lt;em&gt;#197&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DH Specialist would place someone in the library who’s 100% focused on holding an up-to-date overview of the latest DH tools, debates, projects, and challenges. But the DH Specialist can also connect faculty and students to existing Libraries expertise, such as the GIS Specialist’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, I see at least two key benefits added by placing a DH Specialist into the workflow. First, the DH Specialist acts as a proactive ambassador for the digital humanities, making sure people outside the Libraries know about campus support for digital scholarship, that projects like DH ones exist, and that this “GIS” thing is in fact related to their interest in locations and space. Even at UMD, where a strong DH center has existed in the library since 1999, maintaining a campus that knows that resources and mentors and projects and tools exist, for this kind of work, is a difficult and ongoing task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.028.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the DH Specialist acts as a &lt;em&gt;translator&lt;/em&gt; for humanists, helping a professor with a mapping-related query define the questions they should bring the GIS specialist, locate an appropriate and friendly dataset, and refine the scope of the prospective project. After the professor works with the GIS Specialist, the professor might return to the DH Specialist for help building a platform to publish drafts of their work for public feedback, or for help with other theoretical or practical aspects of the whole digital humanities project. By having an ambassador and translator for the digital humanities, the library can draw and support a larger number and scale of scholarly projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PurdueJobTalkImages/PurdueJobTalkImages.029.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;PurdueJobTalkImages.029&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I can overemphasize that everything I’ve just said is just the approaches with which I’d &lt;em&gt;begin&lt;/em&gt; a DH Specialist position. I strongly believe that libraries and the digital humanities per campus have their own flavors, needs, and values. My first step on the job would be intense listening and dialogue with existing campus constituents. This includes practical concerns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;what skills are hard to learn on campus currently?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;are there DH-related service requests that couldn’t be met in the near past?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;how can we help students imagine the careers, DH skills and project experience open to them?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening also means becoming more familiar with existing campus DH projects and colleagues (such as the Research Data Unit and Scholarly Publishing team), and seeing where and how I can best help out. With this caveat of needing to listen, in mind, I believe a service ethic that values planting and tending the seeds for longterm, collaborative commitments—to people as well as projects—offers a trusty route to a significant digital humanities presence at Purdue. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Digital Humanities Annotates (#DHannotates)</title>
   <link href="/2016/02/02/DHannotates"/>
   <updated>2016-02-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/02/02/DHannotates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tech tutorials and documentation are a particularly exciting place for inline annotation, since users can indicate exactly where they got stuck or need additional information. Using the #DHannotates hashtag, we&#39;re encouraging digital humanists to annotate tutorials, documentation, and other DHy webpages as an easy way of improving these resources for the whole community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is&quot;&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; annotation makes inline annotation easy! Simply&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypothes.is/register&quot;&gt;Create a Hypothesis account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefix the URL of the webpage you want to annotate with &lt;strong&gt;https://via.hypothes.is/&lt;/strong&gt; (that is, cut and paste that in front of the link to the page you want to annotate!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annotation feels very intuitive: highlight the text you want to talk about using your mouse cursor, and then type in your comment or question. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for specific steps and pictures that show you everything you can do with annotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve wanted to try out a tech skill like visualization or Python before, but weren&#39;t sure how to start—or started a tutorial and got stuck—read on! (If you&#39;d like to use this in the classroom, &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricarchaeology.ca/2016/02/02/can-we-fix-it-yes-we-can&quot;&gt;see Shawn Graham&#39;s post &quot;Can we fix it? Yes we can! #DHAnnotates Feb 8-12&quot; on the Electric Archaeology site&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Work through a tutorial now (and get help if you encounter a problem!)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now through the end of next week (February 2-12), Shawn Graham and I (and anyone else who wants to volunteer!) will address any &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is&quot;&gt;Hypothesis annotations&lt;/a&gt; created on a particular DH resource: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons&quot;&gt;Programming Historian tutorials&lt;/a&gt; (resources for learning various DH tech skills, written to be friendly to humanists new to coding and other tech work). We&#39;ll answer questions when possible, and when we can&#39;t, we&#39;ll create an issue in the Programming Historian GitHub repo to make sure someone knows about it (we&#39;ll also try to find people who can answer questions via Twitter and the Digital Humanities Slack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Interesting lessons include:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/cleaning-ocrd-text-with-regular-expressions&quot;&gt;Cleaning OCR&#39;d text with regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;, by Laura Turner O&#39;Hara&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet&quot;&gt;Getting Started with Topic Modeling and MALLET&lt;/a&gt;, by Shawn Graham, Scott Weingart, and Ian Milligan &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/googlemaps-googleearth&quot;&gt;Various Google Earth/mapping/GIS lessons&lt;/a&gt;, by Jim Clifford, Josh MacFadyen, and Daniel Macfarlane &lt;/li&gt;

Turkel and Adam Crymble &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions during a tutorial? Ideas for improvements? Get stuck? Want to thank the tutorial&#39;s writers and editors? You can use Hypothesis annotation to add your thoughts.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;If a DHer annotates, does anyone hear?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Feb 2-12, &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricarchaeology.ca/2016/02/02/can-we-fix-it-yes-we-can&quot;&gt;Shawn Graham&lt;/a&gt; and I will respond to Programming Historian annotations and/or add an issue to the site&#39;s GitHub repo so that the annotation is heard and attended to (note, of course, that Programming Historian is written and run by generous volunteers, so help is dependent on volunteers&#39; time... but this is a step toward making sure questions and ideas are seen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beyond next week (2/2-2/12), we&#39;re discussing automating the process of turning Hypothesis annotations into GitHub issues here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/182&quot;&gt;https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/182&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>Digital Dissertations in an Increasingly Welcoming Landscape</title>
   <link href="/2016/01/11/welcomedigitaldissertations"/>
   <updated>2016-01-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/01/11/welcomedigitaldissertations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This audio+slides presentation describes my recent, uniquely non-monograph digital humanities dissertation, which consisted of design, code, blogging, user-testing, and a whitepaper written during just the final month before the defense, *without* accompanying written chapters of proto-monograph. See below the video for a transcript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I survey the increasingly welcoming landscape for doing digital dissertations (especially in the humanities) and look at the practices (and privileges) that help or hinder digital dissertation success. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://Dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;Dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; for the dissertation discussed (includes links to all pieces of the dissertation, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt; participatory digital edition and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.LiteratureGeek.com&quot;&gt;LiteratureGeek.com&lt;/a&gt; blogging) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.TinyURL.com/DHevaluation&quot;&gt;TinyURL.com/DHevaluation&lt;/a&gt; for a Zotero bibliography of articles related to digital humanities dissertations, promotion, and tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was originally presented at the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) Fall 2015 meeting in Washington, D.C. (any extra commas are the result of it being a talk transcript!). If you&#39;re a potential or current digital dissertator (or advising one), you may wish to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation&quot;&gt;check out my complete series of dissertation blogging&lt;/a&gt; from throughout my dissertation experience; it includes practical advice on aspects like arguing for your methodology and dealing with IP and copyright issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/151446633?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/151446633&quot;&gt;Digital Dissertations in an Increasingly Welcoming Landscape&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/user8389727&quot;&gt;LiteratureGeek&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Digital Dissertations in an Increasingly Welcoming Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April this year, I defended a literature dissertation that was unusual in its methodology and form: design, code, user testing, blogging, and a whitepaper written during the final few weeks before the defense. On top of using some digital humanities methods that are becoming more and more recognized and allowed as *some* part of a dissertation and as part of *any* non-dissertational scholarship, though, my dissertation was possibly unique in its format, in that these digital pieces were completely recognized as the full scholarship they were; and you can tell this was the case because there was no proto-monograph: there were zero written chapters. This really wasn&#39;t a case of someone being allowed to do some extra digital scholarship, as long as they did it in addition to a traditionally recognizable set of written chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.001.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to have an incredibly positive digital dissertational experience, which I’ll tell you about more in a moment. First, though, I want to rewind to three years earlier, when I had a very brief roadblock to getting the dissertation off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital dissertations: not actually that special?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that I wanted to design a dissertation this unusual way, and so it made sense to talk to all the parties involved in deciding if I&#39;d receive my doctorate, before starting the work, to make sure we were all on board and on the same page about the project. I had the academic experience of writing my dissertation prospectus under my belt, and the habit of summarizing my research thinking into 140 characters for Twitter, so academic or concise writing weren’t quite the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for whatever reason, I got stuck trying to write just two little paragraphs to share with people like the librarian in charge of ingesting dissertations: two short paragraphs on the methods I wanted to use for my dissertation, why these were the best ways to pursue my research, and what the final deliverables would look like. I was just having a tough time and getting too up in my head about producing this explanation. I couldn&#39;t get my two paragraphs cut down small enough: How did I use two paragraphs to explain not only these whats and whys of my project, and not just the critical thinking behind my use of content management systems, PHP, Javascript, and other technical terms, but what each of those terms meant to the lay person, as well? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was overthinking this a bit and finally my advisor, Matthew Kirschenbaum—who I&#39;ll be introducing a bit later— gently pointed out that trying to explain PHP and Javascript to, for example, my graduate school dean, wasn&#39;t actually an unusual activity or one that was an unfair extra burden of doing digital scholarship. One of the core purposes of the Ph.D., is to bring junior scholars past the pool of shared community knowledge for their first time, to refine your specialization, and otherwise embark on a path where you&#39;ll have a lot of shorthand, and a lot of terms of art, that you&#39;ll always need to be able to explain to all but a handful of other people in the world, if you want them to understand you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a useful moment for me as a scholar, to cut off right there, any sense of special solitude or extra burden caused by doing digital scholarship. The privilege of working with mentors like Matt is that I had a safe space to learn to be pedagogical about my work, rather than defensive; to expect curious listeners instead of defensiveness and lack of understanding, and to sometimes create curiosity about digital methods, if it wasn’t already there, through this pedagogical approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I share this anecdote because I&#39;m hoping to do more today, than just offer my dissertation as a model for student digital scholarship. &lt;strong&gt;Although there&#39;s an interesting conversation to be had around some of the particular, special benefits of doing various types of digital dissertation work, I hope that our conversation during this session can start from, perhaps surprisingly, &lt;em&gt;the many ways doing a digital dissertation is not special&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapters ≠ Dissertation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.007.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, I’d like to see the conversation tend less toward comparing newer types of student research (especially digital methods) to written chapters…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.008.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and I’d like to see us moving the conversation more toward the reasons behind doing a dissertation in the first place. Every dissertating scholar, regardless of the methods and format they use, needs to think through the best methods and format for their scholarly argument. I’d like to see us be pedagogical about how the way we each choose to advance knowledge works, and instead of starting the conversation by focusing on written chapters, start talking instead around what we want the dissertation to do for a student and show about that student, and how *in this moment* we can use many different methods and forms, in critical and scholarly ways, to realize those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I&#39;m going to describe my recent dissertation, and some thoughts about the current environment for digital dissertations. Then, I&#39;ll hand the mic over to Dr. Matthew Kirschenbaum to talk a bit about digital dissertations from the perspective of advising them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital dissertation case study (successfully defended April 2015!)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’m both a web developer and a literature Ph.D., I’m interested in how we can use interface design, to encourage not just public consumption of, but active participation in humanities reading and interpretation, especially with digital editions of literary texts. Scholarly editors—those researchers who create scholarly editions of texts—are integral to the continuum that keeps the stories of the past, available to and understood by the present—but there&#39;s also a less-served public of readers beyond the academy, whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.010.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m especially interested in work that takes digitized and publicly available humanities resources, and makes these truly accessible, beyond just those people who are experts at formulating research questions, and at using online resources to answer these questions. An example of this is the Library of Congress&#39; online hosting of photographs, taken across the U.S. during the Depression as part of a federal work program; this is a fantastic research offering that is theoretically public, but…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.011.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.012.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it took the Photogrammar project creating an interface, for intuitively exploring these photographs, to truly open this piece of our cultural heritage to everyone. I’m interested in crafting humanities interfaces, that help everyone get interested in our cultural heritage, and that make getting involved and following up on curiosity intuitive, through interfaces that make it obvious how to use them and  that care about public participation in research thinking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if we build a digital edition and invite everyone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my dissertation asked this question: What if we build a digital edition and invite everyone, including first-time readers, students, and others outside the academy, to participate in its use? I considered this question by creating and testing the InfiniteUlysses.com participatory digital edition, of James Joyce&#39;s challenging novel Ulysses. As a brief tour of what that site looked like: This is the current front page, and those three big images give a high level tour of the edition&#39;s features: you can highlight parts of the book as you read it and annotate those highlights—that is: leave comments and questions. You can read the annotations left by others; and you can personalize what annotations you see to your background, interests, and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.013.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the screen is the reading interface on Infinite Ulysses. My field of textual scholarship has a long history of building editions and experimenting with textual interfaces, in order to critically explore and perform scholarly arguments, a tradition that helped me argue for design and code as scholarship because of how closely this building and design tied into my research questions. The most productive and efficacious way to learn about and advance public participation in digital editions, was to actually build an experimental digital edition with some new interactive features, this InfiniteUlysses.com site, and then analyze the edition’s use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.014.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, my dissertation consisted of the design work and web development that created the Infinite Ulysses digital edition. Part of my argument for the form of dissertation, was that scholars were theorizing how social digital editions might work, more often than building these theories and actually assessing them; with Ulysses in particular, scholars argued about whether hyperannotation would “diminish” or “break” the text, but hadn’t tried to assess this through testing it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.015.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, various forms of user testing, as well as quantitative and qualitative analyses of the results of these tests, and of site use statistics, were another deliverable of the dissertation. I used my research blog LiteratureGeek.com, to write twice a month through the three years of the dissertation, with posts that examined my research questions as well as metadissertational issues like questions of IP and copyright involved in my project. And finally, I wrote a whitepaper *just* during the final month before my defense, to act as a debriefing and analytical discussion of the dissertation experience, a place to analyze the results of my user testing, and a public accounting of the new knowledge created by my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.017.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://Dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;Dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; served as the single representative website gathering all the pieces of the dissertation, including archival recordings of the digital edition website, and exports of websites, code, and blogs. This website was ingested into my university repository as a ZIP of its web files, plus a one-page PDF abstract for the entire project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenge: evaluating the dissertation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big question with unusual dissertational methodologies is: how will your work be understood and evaluated? The thing being evaluated with my project was the digital edition interface I created, and how I addressed various theoretical questions both through this end product, and through the regular blogging and final whitepaper debriefing I wrote. My committee members weren’t web developers, but they are digital humanists, textual scholars with significant digital edition experience, user interface researchers, and a Joycean; a perfect set of expertise for evaluating an experimental Ulysses digital edition not on the level of critical code studies, but of user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question is: how will technical or specialized work be communicated to the research’s audience? To address this question, my advisor suggested I create a manifest documenting all the pieces of the dissertation in one place. This document explained each piece of work in lay terms, gave a sense of the depth of the work and the critical thought that went into it, and linked to where to look at the work. This was also a perfect place to acknowledge and credit the collaborations in my research, such as opensource code like Drupal, or the improvements to the Annotator Javascript tool Stanford’s Michael Widner generously shared with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenge: administrative time &amp; effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third challenge is: how do we reduce the extra administrative time/effort that stems from unusual dissertational design? There was extra work involved not just for me, but also for my dissertation committee: my advisor Matthew Kirschenbaum and committee members Neil Fraistat, Kari Kraus, Melanie Kill, and Brian Richardson were all incredibly generous with their time and mentorship, and met with me as a team multiple times throughout the three years of the project. Meeting as a team meant that we made better use of the dissertation committee than just drawing them in at the end: it turned feedback on my project into a conversation among several areas of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings also let us reaffirm a mutual understanding of what the deliverables at the time of the defense would look like, and that the committee still found that this outcome satisfies the requirements of a dissertation in my department. I hope we can discuss today how we might provide the same degree of support and time commitment for both busy advisors and advisees. Are there ways we can change our departments forms and templates to offload some of the work of checking in on the progress for dissertations, when it can’t be measured in chapters and drafts? Or to make sure faculty receive special credit or things like course and committee releases, when they commit to this extra level of support for a student’s dissertation? My current university, Purdue, just officially made mentoring undergraduates a written piece of how it judges tenure and promotion cases, and I’m hoping to see this extended to graduate mentorship as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The increasingly welcoming landscape for digital dissertations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to focus on one particular event in the recent environment for digital dissertations now, but I encourage you to check out the Zotero bibliography I&#39;ve built at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHevaluation&quot;&gt;tinyurl.com/DHevaluation&lt;/a&gt;, if you&#39;re interested in more examples of supporting digital dissertations and other digital scholarship. This includes discussions of recent events like CUNY&#39;s livestreamed “Remix the Dissertation” symposium, and relevant dissertations outside the humanities, namely Nick Sousanis&#39; recent dissertation entirely in comics form for an Education Ph.D. at Columbia Teachers College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/graduate/phd-history/digital-dissertation-guidelines&quot;&gt;The guidelines for both partially and fully digital dissertations published by George Mason University’s History and Art History Department this fall&lt;/a&gt; are hopefully a sign other universities and departments will start to give student scholars the freedom to choose the best form and methods of their contribution to academic knowledge. GMU’s guidelines state: &quot;Developments in digital publication platforms and digital history methods have increasingly made it possible for graduate students to produce a culminating work of historical scholarship, that does not take the form of a narrative dissertation. [They] welcome dissertation projects that take a range of digital forms, *while also upholding* the standards of the profession for good scholarly work.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that the GMU guidelines are presented as porous guidelines, that don&#39;t assume we know every form or method a scholar might judge appropriate to their research. The GMU guidelines are also fantastic in pointing back to the values behind a dissertation&#39;s design. Rather than asking &quot;is it written chapters, or if not how like chapters can it be?&quot;, this department has thought carefully about what the dissertation should do, using in part the guidelines for scholarship of the American Historical Association. For example, the guidelines state that any dissertation should perform longstanding values of historical research, like showing the significance of the research, and justifying all methodological choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Justifying your research methods &amp; form: a task for every dissertator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissertators using forms or methods for which their scholarly community does not yet widely understand the nature of the critical process or deliverables, should be responsible for educating others about these. My only quibble with the GMU guidelines is that they put the extra burden on digital dissertators to argue for the aptness of their methods and forms. I disagree: *all* dissertators should argue for the aptness of their methods to their research questions, regardless of if they&#39;re using a form or method that time has shown is generally a good way of pursuing research questions in that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.027.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What matters is the appropriateness of method and form to your particular research questions&lt;/strong&gt;. You want to choose how you best think through ideas and convey your critical thinking, so that you end up with the best possible support for your scholarly argument. Digital or not, dissertating scholars should ask themselves questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What format best supports what you’re arguing, and best reaches the most people who can use and build on your work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you used a different format, what would be possible? What would you lose and gain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And on the practical side of things, what skills do you want to learn? Do your form and methods support your career plans? How will you deal with job applications that require longform writing samples, and otherwise present your work to an audience unfamiliar with digital scholarship?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pros of using my digital dissertation as a model...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad my dissertation experience counters some of the common objections to student work that innovates in form and method. It is not written in stone, for example, that you will not get any job, or the kind of job you want (including if that happens to be the troubled tenure-track position); or that you won&#39;t be able to finish the Ph.D. in five years. Using social media and eschewing an embargo can result in more people knowing about your work and more opportunities for collaboration and publication, not less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps most importantly, it is possible, given the right circumstances, to do a digital dissertation that fully recognizes your digital scholarship and doesn&#39;t require you to double your labor by producing anything digital as extra effort alongside the traditional multiple written chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But don&#39;t forget the privileges &amp; risks of doing a digital dissertation!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d be remiss to not address those “right circumstances”, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CNI presentation slide&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CNISlideImage.028.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissertators need permission from ourselves, and permission for our departments that this path can lead to success, and I think as dissertations like mine and guidelines like GMU&#39;s proliferate, more students will find this permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dissertators also need more environments that let them take risks and that recognize that these risks are not just intellectual ones, but personal risks involving being able to provide for yourself and your family, pay down student loans, and find a job that will let you be happy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As departments begin to support more diverse forms of doctoral scholarship, I hope we can use sessions like this one to discuss how the greater scholarly ecosystem of universities, libraries, publishers, and others can contribute to supporting these innovators once they’ve graduated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q&amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk was followed by remarks from my dissertation advisor, Matthew Kirschenbaum, who himself defended one of the very first digital literature dissertations; we also had lots of time for audience discussion, as well as time for me to note some of the specific privileges I alluded to in the main talk (e.g. my working at a major, on-campus DH center since halfway through my master&#39;s degree; experience teaching myself technical skills; active interest in an alternative academic career). Unfortunately the microphone wasn&#39;t working, but I captured the following notes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt emphasized that (despite what might be most entertaining to hear), there was no &quot;backroom drama&quot; to my dissertation: administration throughout my university was welcoming to our approach of presenting a succinct, clear explanation of the necessity of my methods and form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt noted that language and expectations at the department level still expect written chapters (e.g. a departmental award asks that the any dissertations nominated for the prize be submitted as &quot;an electronic copy of the whole dissertation in PDF form&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience question: My (Amanda&#39;s) dissertation was collaborative in terms of building on and recognizing others&#39; code, but what about truly networked dissertations—dissertations that succeed as members of a group of dissertating researchers? One answer: The UVa Scholars&#39; Lab Praxis Program (which supports a team of fellows through real collaborative work on a DH project) might be a place to look for such connected dissertation in the near future, especially since the program realistically allows team members to each focus on different DH roles that fit their interests and background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience question: What is the responsibility of scholars who create public/participatory projects (like InfiniteUlysses.com) as their dissertation—should they be expected to maintain and build on this work through to the time of their tenure case? Should a failure to do so be a mark against their scholarship? One answer: Responsibility and care for the audience of your research should be marks in favor of your evaluated scholarship, especially for scholarship that is consciously public-serving. While keeping in mind that the emotional labor and capacity to support such projects can be difficult and requires certain privileges, having a plan in place for the longterm existence of your scholarship is an aspect of good research (even if that&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m being very public about this site only lasting online for one year and I&#39;ll post clear directions for users to export their work/data&quot;...) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience question: How can libraries/university repositories help preserve digital humanities dissertations? (Some answers: Be aware that ProQuest will let you ingest things like web sites, code, and audio. But this is really the same problem that DH centers face with everyone project, and there&#39;s no one-size-fits-all answer with such experimental websites.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience question: What can librarians do to support digital dissertations before and during the dissertation? One answer: serve as advocates and translators for students seeking to innovate, e.g. accompany students when they meet with their department to discuss their format, and help the student establish historical scholarly precedents for their work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Filter Problem at the CODEX Literary Hackathon</title>
   <link href="/2016/01/04/codex"/>
   <updated>2016-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/01/04/codex</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m at &lt;a href=&quot;http://codexhackathon.com&quot;&gt;the MIT Media Lab&#39;s CODEX Literary Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; this weekend—an event focused on prototyping tools for the future of digital reading, books, libraries, and publishing. Below is my description of the annotation &quot;filter problem&quot;, the research challenge that I&#39;m bringing to the table at the event (although I might end up working on something else—we&#39;ll see!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I pitched &quot;Team Annotation&quot; and we ended up getting around ten people together to brainstorm annotation, before breaking into several smaller project teams. Read our Team Annotation notes &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackdash.org/projects/568ff7e062b2cc5d050af6c8&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and see what I ended up hacking on &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackdash.org/projects/5692943e62b2cc5d050af71e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better online communities and the “filter problem”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Making “internet comments”, web annotation, and other types of online communal knowledge-making not terrible means balancing our inability to read everything (all the comments on a topic) with a desire to defeat the echo-chamber effect of Facebook-style algorithmic personalization based on what we like/favorite the most, which isn&#39;t a good fit for reading and learning—we want to hear differing interpretations and ideas that challenge and unsettle us, rather than get a smooth Facebook experience. I&#39;m interested in code and design work addressing the need for nuanced information filtering, balancing digital fixes like mechanics for crowdsourcing curation &amp; moderation with community design solutions like interfaces that scaffold good digital citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran my first test of these ideas about balancing algorithmic and community curation of public discussion by building &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt;, experimenting with crowd commentary around a notoriously difficult novel and rejuvenating a platform traditionally aimed only at scholars (the digital edition) via social mechanics used on sites like Reddit and StackExchange. My design both supported social textual annotation, and also personalized (at a very basic level) the display of the resulting huge quantity of public-authored annotations to fit each reader&#39;s needs and background. Our filtering work could be on the Infinite Ulysses site itself, elsewhere using Infinite Ulysses&#39; code, or something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Front page screenshot of InfiniteUlysses.com&quot; src=&quot;/assets/3-7-2015_FrontScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit + Ulysses, anyone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, might we experiment with balancing both coded mechanics and social curation to give people better reading experiences: a non-overwhelming amount of annotations per page, tuned to their interests, background, and needs? Some steps we could start to brainstorm and prototype:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brainstorm more ways of filtering annotations than by date, author, popularity, and popularity of the author&#39;s other annotations, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think about how we can make it easy and enjoyable for readers to add the metadata allowing this additional annotation filtering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone interested in algorithmic learning might draft a questionnaire that guesses the filters a given reader might want applied to their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone interested in community design could work on a set of best practices for reading sites to implement before inviting social annotation (e.g. how to seed the annotations with model commentary).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also especially interested in anything related to annotation, social reading, and communities designed around various types of &quot;difficult&quot; text (challenging to read, politically contentious, requiring deep field or historical knowledge to understand...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The future of a thing is a return to its values</title>
   <link href="/2016/01/04/scholarlydigitaleditions"/>
   <updated>2016-01-04T13:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2016/01/04/ScholarlyDigitalEditions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I keep pulling the same tool out of my bag this year: does &lt;strong&gt;the thing we&#39;ve built&lt;/strong&gt; match &lt;strong&gt; the values behind why we built it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Must&lt;/em&gt; a dissertation have written chapters?&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;) Or is the value of a dissertation that it lets you practice and prove the values and skills your scholarly field needs its members to share, and are there other methods for doing that than writing a proto-monograph? (&lt;em&gt;Easy answer: yes &amp; yes, see my example at &lt;a href=&quot;http://Dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;Dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Must&lt;/em&gt; a digital edition focus on the same methods as a scholarly print edition?&lt;/strong&gt; Recension, conjecture, work at the word-level (or below) of a text are key methods for many scholarly editors, but work that pushes the field of textual scholarship ahead can also look like &lt;a href=&quot;http://maker.uvic.ca/ulysses&quot;&gt;a museum exhibit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/264/329&quot;&gt;iPad app&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation&quot;&gt;experimental code&lt;/a&gt;: what matters is attention to the core values of textual scholarship, like clearly arguing for your methodology, establishing the authority of your text, etc. (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf&quot;&gt;Section 4: Reimagining Editions in my recent whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; for lots more plus real examples!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating original values from how they ended up manifested—and not making the mistake that the final artifact is the same thing as the originating values—has been a productive thought experiment for me this year. (Of course, I don&#39;t ignore questions about how those &quot;originating values&quot; came together in the first place, and how they might be altered or replaced for the better...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jennifer Steenshorne just distributed a short survey on the future of scholarly editions via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhhumanist.org&quot;&gt;HUMANIST listserv&lt;/a&gt;; you can contribute to the survey yourself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XXPZWNH&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! She writes that the survey is for a round table discussion at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Historical Association, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aha.confex.com/aha/2016/webprogram/Session13356.html&quot;&gt;Documentary Editors Engage the 21st Century&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the survey got me to summarize some thinking about digital editions vs. scholarly digital editions over the past year, I share my answers here as well. All question headings are from Dr. Steenshorne&#39;s survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&quot;How do you define a digital scholarly edition?&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I think using &quot;scholarly digital edition&quot; (SDE) for something that digitally approximates a scholarly print edition is useful for our community: we want an easy way of calling out when the same (or digital counterparts of) scholarly activities of versioning, recension, word-level decisions, etc. are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differently&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;digital edition* to me&lt;/em&gt; is a broader category sitting above the SDE, meaning *any* digital work (site, performance, museum exhibit) that show it values the same values motivating scholarly editing activities as an SDE, but possibly in different and often experimental ways: that is, imagining other means of manifesting textual scholarship&#39;s core values (authority, clearly defined and discussed methodology...). Unlike a scholarly digital edition, digital editions are a more open term allowing scholar-creators to experiment with new ways of manifesting these core field values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&quot;What are the most useful buzz words or concepts (like Big Data) in digital humanities, particularly for scholarly digital editions?&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Public literature, participatory edition/archive, citizen scholars, meaningful crowdsourcing, linked open data, exportable data, web annotation. I&#39;d like to see more room for discussions of textual materiality, screen essentialism, e-lit and artistic design, interface design, user testing and usability, audiences, diversity (what authors get edition projects funded &amp; popular; who makes editions and who gets the credit; the audiences for which editions get made).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&quot;What are the most annoying or overused buzz words or concepts (like Big Data) in digital humanities, particularly for scholarly digital editions?&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;Aside: I like and understand what this question is asking, but I&#39;m a tiny bit uncomfortable with IDing &quot;buzz words&quot;, as thinking of something as &quot;buzzwordy&quot; is an easy way to dismiss it instead of at least acknowledge that someone is thinking critically about it, and it probably has a history of critical thought stretching back way before it became popular enough for people not involved in it to randomly hear about it (e.g. I&#39;m a digital humanist, and I&#39;ve both seen others dismiss DH as a buzzword, and encountered people actually using it as a buzzword &quot;the funders will want to see us include&quot;). I know it&#39;s shorthand for &quot;I wish we&#39;d talk about this thing more too/instead if time is limited&quot;, but shorthand isn&#39;t the most useful thing if it has a high misfire rate for interpretation... so it&#39;s something I want to notice and be careful about using myself.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things I wish we&#39;d talk about more—and on the flip side, the concepts I think distract from the discussions I wish we were having? I&#39;d like to see more room for discussions of textual materiality, screen essentialism, e-lit and artistic design, interface design, user testing and usability, audiences, diversity (what authors get edition projects funded &amp; popular; who makes editions and who gets the credit; the audiences for which editions get made).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve moved from TEI/textual markup to work focused on the things I listed above, so sometimes I&#39;m sad when a conversation about digital textual scholarship means a discussion solely focused on markup instead of also including other aspects of textual scholarship, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; on the other hand I&#39;m extremely privileged and happy that such strong work on textual encoding exists and continues, and that I feel like I can focus on other aspects of a textual project knowing this area of textual work has both a past and a rich present of strong exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&quot;What are some of the most exciting new scholarly digital edition projects you have seen and why?&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/sc/oxford/frankenstein/volume/i#/p1&quot;&gt;Shelley-Godwin Archive&lt;/a&gt; is doing interesting work in involving editors at different stages of expertise (from students on up) and signaling to users what degree of quality a given set of markup guarantees (instead of hiding everything from public use until it&#39;s all 100% checked by a professional editor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SHORE consortium is bringing together a number of key scholarly editors, edition developers, and scholarly period societies so that when one edition develops a new tool (e.g. Infinite Ulysses&#39; social annotation), all participating editions will share the same technical backend and can therefore also use the new tool. Additionally, we&#39;ll start to gather a dataset of both scholarly and public literary annotations across the literary periods (medieval, modern, Victorian...) and be able to learn new things about digital reading and research. The first example site fully migrated into SHORE is &lt;a href=&quot;http://CoveCollective.org&quot;&gt;CoveCollective.org&lt;/a&gt; (currently under alpha testing, but there&#39;s a consortium meeting and public talks at Purdue in May 2016).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ride.i-d-e.de&quot;&gt;RIDE digital edition review journal&lt;/a&gt; is building scholarly review for SDEs that is aware of technical and design work as a critical component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt; uniquely invites the public into the critical conversation around James Joyce&#39;s challenging novel Ulysses via user-authored social annotation. Additionally, the edition experiments with mechanics for social curation and moderation of the annotations, and attempts to personalize the annotations displayed to each reader&#39;s expertise, needs, and interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;My recent digital dissertation&lt;/a&gt; was based around this project—&lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;&quot;&#39;How can you love a work, if you don&#39;t know it?&#39;: Critical Code and Design toward Participatory Digital Editions&quot;&lt;/a&gt; used entirely digital humanities methods (design, code, blogging, user testing) to create and analyze various theories about public and social digital editions (especially those supporting social annotation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To explain why &lt;a href=&quot;InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt; is a digital edition but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a scholarly digital edition, part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf&quot;&gt;my whitepaper on the Infinite Ulysses project and dissertation around it&lt;/a&gt; deals directly with a number of edition and edition-like objects (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF link&lt;/a&gt; and see Section 4: Reimagining Editions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&quot;What would you like to see more of in scholarly digital editions?&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Things related to making our hard scholarly effort reach people outside the professoriate (editions for new students, for new readers; a more public literature, enabled by textual scholarship plus digital humanities), and to making sure that work lasts in an accessible form beyond the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introducing Static Sites for Digital Humanities Projects (why & what are Jekyll, GitHub, etc.?)</title>
   <link href="/2015/12/08/WhyJekyllGitHub"/>
   <updated>2015-12-08T07:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/12/08/WhyJekyllGitHub</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m working with my university press on new models for DH scholarship... and as I started typing up a description of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and GitHub for a proposed DH book project, I ended up discussing not just Jekyll and GitHub but also defining static vs. dynamic sites, git and versioning, and GitHub pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought I&#39;d share this as a starting point for others! (&lt;em&gt;Caveat emptor: this is one of those emails that turned into a huge email that turned into a blog post.&lt;/em&gt;) If you want to be superfancy, you can click &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://literaturegeek.com/2015-12-08-WhyJekyllGitHub&quot;&gt;this link to annotate the page with questions and requests for clarification, comments, and suggestions&lt;/a&gt; using the magic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is&quot;&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, and I&#39;ll work on refining this into a more exhaustive FAQ as time allows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are.... dynamic versus static websites?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic sites (like Drupal or WordPress) pull information from a database to populate a page; when you search for some words on Amazon.com, for example, the search results page you are shown didn’t already exist as a full HTML page—Amazon.com has a template for search results page with things they all share like their main menu and logo, but it queries the database to insert the results of that search you initiated. Jekyll is a “static site generator” in that it takes page templates (those things like main menus and footers, shared across all the web pages) and other files with specific information (e.g. a file for each blog post on the site) and combines these into full HTML pages for the site visitors to see (i.e. generating a static site, aka a folder of HTML files)—and these are already put together and ready to serve up when you&#39;re visiting the site. That is, Jekyll doesn’t need to do anything like querying a database when you visit a page; it’s already got the pages fully formed, and it just updates them when and if they ever change. (For someone who took more time to think through a metaphor for static site generation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators&quot;&gt;check out this post&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How is Jekyll like Drupal/WordPress/Omeka/[other CMS]?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is like software called content management systems (CMSs) such as Drupal or WordPress in that it’s a set of code that makes a website run and handles certain repeated tasks like displaying a logo and menubar on every page, creating a searchable archive of blog posts, etc. Unlike CMSs, though, Jekyll doesn’t have a web “dashboard” (that shiny UI you use to administrate the website: moderating comments, writing a blog post from within the live site...). And! Jekyll does not use a database (the source of a lot of code and security headaches in CMSs like Drupal). If you don’t need the power and possibilities behind these CMSs, it’s often better for effort, security, and preservation not to use them. Or if you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; some of the things that Jekyll particularly offers...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why/when Jekyll?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versioning! Security (no database hacking) and less sysadminy hassle in general. Speed of loading pages. Free and easy to set up and host with GitHub Pages, and it&#39;s then linked into the GitHub.com ecosystem of code versioning, sharing, and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll doesn’t work as well if you have a site like Amazon.com that basically lets visitors create a huge number of custom pages by making complex searches from a huge set of things, since it’s easier for Amazon.com to create search result pages on the fly from their database than to store an HTML page for each possible search result combination. But for a site where you can largely imagine now what all the pages will look like (e.g. a digital book), Jekyll is faster, lighter, and better for longterm security and preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GitHub.com, git, and repos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub.com is a site where people share code they’ve written so others can reuse it, build on it, and report bugs and feature requests. It’s based on git, which is software for versioning code: keeping track of the various changes in code over time as people add, subtract, and otherwise edit that text. People use GitHub.com for things other than code including blogging and professional writing, since it supports keeping track of multiple versions of a text and is friendly to collaboratively authored text. (Other sites besides GitHub use git, and you can use git without GitHub.com. GitHub.com is just a wildly popular public platform for sharing and working on versioned code.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub “repos&quot; (repositories) are just collections of code; for example, I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-dissertation&quot;&gt;one repo with all the code involved in my dissertation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/EncodedCurtain&quot;&gt;another repo that shares an old Omeka maintenance-page hack I wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages can be located for free at a GitHub subdomain such as amandavisconti.github.io/SGAPedagogyPage (where amandavisconti is my GitHub username and SGAPedagogyPage is the name of the GitHub repository holding its web files). You can also purchase from elsewhere and use your own domain name with the same site (as I did for LiteratureGeek.com). Custom domain names aren’t permanently bought, so you need to renew your license over them from time to time (you can do this once a year or buy a bunch of years at a time; the type of domain names a DHer might want to acquire usually cost around $10-20 each per year... except if you want DH.center, they will overcharge you for that!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to use GitHub or GitHub pages to use Jekyll; you could, for example, use commercial or university web hosting. I like GitHub Pages hosting because it’s free, uses git (which manages multiple versions and drafts of collaboratively authored/edited texts nicely), is set up to make Jekyll use easier, and because GitHub is already the most popular place for DH data sharing, code and text versioning, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can I use these for projects that might have a commercial aspect (e.g. a book series with digital components)?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think so. Jekyll is free and open-source. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Its code&lt;/a&gt; can be used for commercial projects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE&quot;&gt;its MIT License file&lt;/a&gt; with its attribution to the Jekyll creator should be kept with the rest of the files). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; are webpages hosted for free on GitHub.com. GitHub Pages can run Jekyll. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.LiteratureGeek.com&quot;&gt;LiteratureGeek.com research blog&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a site using Jekyll to run the site and GitHub Pages to host the site. According to this page, commercial use of GitHub Pages is allowed, though because GitHub retains the right to alter that, anyone using it in a book project should have a backup plan in place (something very simple: time required, who to contact, cost of transferring to university or commercial web hosting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do begin to use GitHub for multiple DH projects, you’ll want to look into their various plans, as the default free plans are set up for individual use and public repositories (e.g. you might want multiple private repositories so sites can be developed there before going public). There are various options including free plans for educational and non-profit uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There you have it, an only slightly-cleaned-up email turned into a blog post! It isn&#39;t meant to be a universal resource, but feel free to comment/suggest using &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://literaturegeek.com/2015-12-08-WhyJekyllGitHub&quot;&gt;Hypothesis via this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>ACH Executive Council</title>
   <link href="/2015/11/20/ACH-executive-council"/>
   <updated>2015-11-20T07:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/11/20/ACH-executive-council</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m running for a seat on the Executive Council of the ACH (Association for Computers and the Humanities), the professional society for the digital humanities. If you&#39;re a member, please consider voting for me! I&#39;d bring a focus on&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;support for undergrad and grad students&lt;/strong&gt; (particularly in getting their DH work fully accepted as scholarship, whether as coursework or dissertation) and on &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;improving the DH social media community&lt;/strong&gt; (making it easier for new DHers to be involved, expanding the teaching/learning we do via social media, and improving how backchannels like Twitter and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/1jI8VUx&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; are preserved and made accessible).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Candidate statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m honored to be nominated for a position on the ACH Executive Council. As a recent Ph.D., I&#39;m especially interested in &lt;strong&gt;advocating for student digital humanists&lt;/strong&gt;, such as reaching out to the Undergraduate Network for Research in the Humanities (UNRH) and assembling a central web resource for digital humanities dissertations: case studies, administrative documents used by successful dissertators, and links to supporting arguments and tutorials for DH forms of graduate research. (&lt;em&gt;The structure of this resource could be cloned to support a paired second site focused on review and promotion applications by those in DH job roles—managed by another ACH volunteer—as there are considerable overlaps in these two challenging areas.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also interested in &lt;strong&gt;supporting and improving the ways the digital humanities community uses Twitter and other social media&lt;/strong&gt;, especially as developing technologies such as Slack (online messaging and chat rooms) and Hypothes.is (web annotation) become part of our online ecosystem. In the case of Slack, anchoring &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/1jI8VUx&quot;&gt;the new DH Slack team&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve organized—which now has 197 digital humanist members!—to ACH would let us argue for non-profit status, which confers benefits like better chat history and search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to &lt;strong&gt;standardize how we preserve DH social media&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly tweets using various DH conference hashtags, by exploring whether a specific ACH role could be in charge of capturing these in a given year and storing them in a publicly accessible space. I&#39;d also like to &lt;strong&gt;investigate ways of encouraging the DH Q &amp; A site as a first-stop intro to DH&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. a wiki for FAQs like what conference acronyms and hashtags stand for) and whether social mechanics (favoriting, badges) might motivate more DHers to ask and answer questions on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a DH hybrid: a web developer, as well as librarian, assistant professor, and the Digital Humanities Specialist at the Purdue University Libraries. I recently completed a digital humanities dissertation in the University of Maryland English Department, and I also hold a master&#39;s degree from the University of Michigan School of Information, where I tailored a Digital Humanities HCI specialization. I worked in a number of positions at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) fromm 2009-2015, beginning as an IMLS Model Digital Humanities Intern and ending as the Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow. I&#39;ve been a professional web developer for over eight years, and most of my research takes the form of making things for the web.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been active in the digital humanities community since 2009, tweeting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot;&gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt; and keeping a popular DH blog at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.LiteratureGeek.com&quot;&gt;LiteratureGeek.com&lt;/a&gt; (11 posts have been highlighted on DH Now; LiteratureGeek.com/tag/dh-now). My major projects include co-organizing the inaugural THATCamp Games with Anastasia Salter, applying one of the inaugural ACH Microgrants (now Incubator Grants) to visualize Digital Humanities Quarterly&#39;s citation network, the creation of a participatory digital edition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt;; over 13,000 unique visitors during its first month of open beta), and successfully designing and defending a unique &quot;born-digital&quot; digital humanities dissertation consisting of design, code, user-testing, blogging, and a whitepaper written in the final weeks of the project (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;Dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Contact me at aviscont@purdue.edu or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot;&gt;@literature_geek&lt;/a&gt; about speaking at your institution! You can read more about me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;my online portfolio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Possible topics:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital humanities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the digital humanities&lt;/strong&gt; and why is it good for my department/university? How can I get started in the digital humanities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participatory digital editions&lt;/strong&gt; and other DH projects that invite and support a &lt;strong&gt;public humanities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scholarly social media&lt;/strong&gt; for better and happier research (blogging and Twitter in particular)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research blogging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Digital humanities dissertations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing and pursuing a successful digital dissertation&lt;/strong&gt; (I successfully defended &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;a wholly digital, no-chapters literature dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in April 2015 and am now in a tenure-track assistant professorship… and I blogged throughout both about my research and about the dissertation process.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting digital dissertations&lt;/strong&gt; and other digital student work: &lt;strong&gt;how to evaluate digital work&lt;/strong&gt;, support it and track effort while it’s happening, and how to argue for the necessity of a digital format and/or method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Digital humanities technology &amp; training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing digital humanities websites&lt;/strong&gt; (and other interfaces)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web annotation&lt;/strong&gt; for research, teaching, and learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital humanities web development, design, and user/usability testing&lt;/strong&gt;, including workshops on specific skills like GitHub/git for the classroom, Omeka for textual scholars, making and hosting your first web page (HTML5 and CSS3), or starting your own research blog (from setting up the website through writing your first post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User experience design&lt;/strong&gt; for the digital humanities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching digital humanities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to consult informally with faculty, students, and staff interested in learning a digital skill, pursuing a digital project, or doing/mentoring a digital dissertation while on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A small sample of cool digital humanities info visualization projects & tools</title>

   <id>/2015/09/25/infovizlinks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
A handful of interesting projects, lesson plans, and tools for digital humanities information visualization (aka infoviz, sometimes aka data visualization). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://processing.org/tutorials/&#39;  &gt;Tutorials&lt;/a&gt; for making introductory information visualizations with the Processing language (&quot;a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wefeelfine.org&quot;&gt;We Feel Fine&lt;/a&gt; by Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar is a visualization project that scrapes current social media posts to explore human emotion in visually beautiful ways, and it&#39;s always been a hit with my students (the hard part is when they want to build something like it!). I couldn&#39;t get it to load in my browser this week, so it may no longer work.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;There&#39;s lots of other great visualization, image, and network stuff out there! This was just to blog an email of relevant links I put together after discussing a humanities visualization course that was being designed. Eventually, hoping to combine links like these from various places (Instapaper, Twitter favorites, LibGuides, Zotero) and get them nicely tagged, so pulling out DH work relevant to a project or course being designed isn&#39;t entirely based on what I can recall off the top of my head...&lt;/em&gt;</content>

   <title>Digital dissertation defended!</title>
   <link href="/2015/05/09/dissertationdefended"/>
   <updated>2015-05-09T20:57:06-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post to note that I successfully defended my digital dissertation on April 14th, 2015 and completed my Literature Ph.D. Check out the finished project at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt;! (And I&#39;m now on the job market for alternative academic positions, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandavisconti&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;let me know if you&#39;re looking to hire&lt;/a&gt; someone with 8+ years of professional interface design experience on a strong research background!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to links to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses participatory digital edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-public&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;public code/design repo&lt;/a&gt;, the project site links out to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dissertation.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;whitepaper covering the process and product&lt;/a&gt; of my project, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/#dissabstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; for the whole project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-public/blob/master/About%20the%20Dissertation/MANIFEST.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a manifest listing and describing all the pieces of work&lt;/a&gt; that went into the project, and of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all my research blog posts during the project here on the blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#39;t been following along, the dissertation is worth checking out even if you&#39;re not interested in the digital humanities, participatory interface design, or &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;: I use a novel approach combining design, code, user-testing, site analytics, and blogging, without the traditional 4-5 chapters of proto-monograph.

Matthew Kirschenbaum (chair), Neil Fraistat, Melanie Kill, Kari Kraus (also Dean&#39;s Representative), and Brian Richardson — for their intellectual and personal generosity. In particular, their willingness to learn about, support, and refine my project&#39;s unique format and methodology; meeting with me as a team and always being available for discussion throughout the course of the project; and thoughtful evaluation of unusual deliverables for a literature dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also grateful to the University of Maryland English Department, UMD Graduate School and Dean Charles Caramello, and the UMD Libraries Digital Repository for their support of my unique format and methodology, as well as the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) and its stellar staff for introducing me to the digital humanities; intellectual stimulation, community, and funding; and mentorship in diverse digital skills and staff roles.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Evaluating Non-Traditional Digital Humanities Dissertations</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/30/evaluating-non-traditional-digital-humanities-dissertations"/>
   <updated>2014-09-30T07:55:37-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/30/evaluating-non-traditional-digital-humanities-dissertations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most of the online advice I&#39;ve encountered for evaluating non-traditional scholarly projects seems to focus on seeking jobs or applying for tenure with a portfolio that is significantly digital; the process of translating that body of work for a reviewing committee matches up pretty well with how evaluation works for the dissertation defense process for a non-traditional and/or digital project (and I&#39;ve covered some of these suggestions at the end of this post). &lt;strong&gt;Charting progress and recording effort throughout the non-traditional dissertation&lt;/strong&gt;, though, is a mostly undiscussed topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a unique format scrubs a lot of the traditional methods for evaluating these factors: maybe there&#39;s no &quot;chapter&quot; to turn in, or you&#39;ve undertaken a critical building project in a programming language your committee can&#39;t read (and even if your committee could read through the entire body of code you author, you wouldn&#39;t want them to need to—just as with a monograph project, you want to be respectful of mentors&#39; time by asking for feedback at specific milestones and with some kind of concise artifact to assess).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dissertation has a unique format—there&#39;s no monograph, and the bulk of the work is blogging, design, coding, user-testing, and analysis of testing data. I&#39;ve come up with a comfortable set of practices that let me keep my dissertation committee updated and on-board with my expected outcomes, give me some handy accountability to produce a reasonable amount of weekly work, and clearly document my effort and progress in case administrators even request evidence of the equivalency of my research with that of students using a more time-tested format. This post will cover how I&#39;m recording my progress and sharing recognizable milestones with my advisor and committee;  I use a combination of GitHub, Zapier (an IFTT-like service), Basecamp, scheduled emails, and GoogleDocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub for evaluating any type of writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using GitHub to manage my code (more below), but it turns out GitHub has a lot of nifty ways for me to let my advisor and committee have a sense of my coding progress and effort—visualizations that would work just as well for someone using GitHub to track changes in their writing, for example. I&#39;ve added my advisor as a collaborator on my dissertation code repository so that he can also see the progress charted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/commits.png&quot; alt=&quot;List of commit messages for GitHub code&quot; width=&quot;504&quot; height=&quot;571&quot;&gt; Example code commits give a summary of what the code I&#39;m adding to the repository achieves (e.g. did it fix a specific bug? add a new feature?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the text you&#39;re working with is code, GitHub lets you track frequency and quantity of work, and offers some nifty visualizations to give you an overview of your work habits. With a project where you&#39;re learning or advancing a technical skill, this can be a nice way of showing that even if something you spent two weeks on didn&#39;t pan out (e.g. I ended up not using my Islandora digital edition work), you were doing active work during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub visualization options include (note all examples are from a repo opened at the end of August):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viewing the number of code commits made by week:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/commitsbyweek.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub bar chart of code commits by week.&quot; width=&quot;194&quot; height=&quot;161&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluating your work habits by showing a &quot;punchcard&quot; of what days of the week and times of day you commit the most code (mostly sticking to my commitment to not dissertate on weekends so far!):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charting code additions and deletions by week:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/addsdeletesperweek.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub chart of code additions and deletions by week.&quot; width=&quot;727&quot; height=&quot;552&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; GitHub for code tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sharedrepo-300x37.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/myrepo-300x39.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;39&quot; &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m managing my dissertation code via a completely private repository that regularly gets pulled into a private repository that only certain collaborators can view (sharing read-only code to only select people is slightly roundabout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using GitHub to backup and track my coding work for all the regular webdev reasons (lots of copies keeps stuff safe, it will be easy to release code to the public when it&#39;s ready, etc.). Part of my deliverable work is good documentation of my coding, so I need to keep the repository README updated. (A repository, aka &quot;repo&quot;, is the place on GitHub where my code is stored, which you can visit and view as webpages; a README is a text file sharing some information about that repo, visible at the bottom of the front page of a GitHub repository).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/readme.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the README file from my code repository.&quot; width=&quot;793&quot; height=&quot;671&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;README file explaining what the code in the repository does/will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the README in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A place to explain&lt;/strong&gt; what my code does, why I made certain technical choices, and (once the repository becomes publicly accessible) how anyone can use my code for their own research (e.g. dependencies, installation and configuration instructions, where to ask for help).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A place to track and visibly credit&lt;/strong&gt; the various pieces of FOSS (free and open-source) code that my project builds off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/morereadme.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of README file describing provenance of code in my repository.&quot; width=&quot;824&quot; height=&quot;578&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking the provenance of various code collections I&#39;m building off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project focuses on creating and testing new interface abilities by building off existing wheels such as Drupal (for the site structure itself) and Annotator.js (for the core textual annotation functionality). Many of the terms of the various FOSS licenses on these code collections dictate that I attribute this work properly, but even without such licenses visible and detailed attribution would be extremely important to me. Everyone should get credit and thanks for sharing their work with others! (See the awesome &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mcpress.media-commons.org/offthetracks/part-one-models-for-collaboration-career-paths-acquiring-institutional-support-and-transformation-in-the-field/a-collaboration/collaborators%E2%80%99-bill-of-rights&quot;&gt;Collaborators&#39; Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that came out of a MITH workshop for more on why correct credit should matter to everyone). Plus, making it clear that this project is founded on a variety of existing code sets might encourage others to think about platforms that could emerge from combining or augmenting existing code, giving us new tools and approaches instead of sinking time into reinventing wheels. Since I&#39;ll also be producing a lot of my own reusable code (plugins, interface), this page will also help me make it clear to future employers what pieces of code are authored by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basecamp for project progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basecamp is a project management tool that also works well for teaching courses (&lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/teachers&quot; &gt;and it&#39;s free for teachers!&lt;/a&gt;) or working on solo projects. Among other features, it lets you create various task lists containing tasks with due dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/basecampexample.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of tasks on a Basecamp task list&quot; width=&quot;753&quot; height=&quot;113&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the tasks in my Basecamp project; this list is helping me track what needs to be done before I start alpha-testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basecamp will also help me automatically turn feedback from user-testing into tasks on my dissertation to-do list, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://Zapier.com&quot; &gt;Zapier,&lt;/a&gt; a service that connects various other internet services (e.g. get an email when one of your tweets is RT&#39;d, and other &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com&quot; &gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt;-like options).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/zapier.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of using Zapier to turn GitHub issues into Basecamp tasks&quot; width=&quot;928&quot; height=&quot;179&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Zapier to create Basecamp tasks from GitHub issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub repositories allow people to create &quot;issues&quot;, which are like comments on the code or software in the repository; I&#39;ll then place labels on these issues depending on what type of problem they represent: a bug, a feature request, or something out of scope for the dissertation project. Once issues get a label, they automatically appear on a Basecamp task-list as to-dos containing the text in the issue and assigning me a due date to address that issue in the next two weeks. You can get started similarly managing GitHub issues using this Zap by using &lt;a href=&quot;http://zpr.io/G6Wv&quot; &gt;the template I&#39;ve shared&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/issues.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of issues in my GitHub repository&quot; width=&quot;568&quot; height=&quot;349&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some example issues on my GitHub repository; each issue automatically became a to-do with a due date on my Basecamp project after I labeled the issue, thanks to Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emails and GoogleDocs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve scheduled myself to create a weekly email to my advisor covering three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what I accomplished on the dissertation over the past week,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what my goals were for the following week, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anything I needed him to do or read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These emails are both useful in keeping my advisor up to date with my work and as a record of that progress, should we ever need to demonstrate it to university administration (although &lt;a title=&quot;Five Tips for Getting Started on a Digital Humanities Dissertation&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve gotten written consent for my unique dissertation format from the interested parties as described in this post&lt;/a&gt;, so I&#39;m not expecting to actually need these records). Weekly emails are also effective for me as a carrot and/or stick: I know I need to make some progress during the week or the email will be empty, and writing the email reminds me of all the things I got done in a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My four dissertation committee members have been awesomely willing to meet with me as a team. I&#39;ve met with them all in the same room twice so far at milestones during my dissertation process (once while designing the dissertation and preparing the prospectus, and once when I was starting to have a good idea of what the final project deliverables would look like). We&#39;ll be meeting again in the next weeks as I finish site functionality and begin user-testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting as a team has been a great way to make feedback into a conversation among several areas of expertise. It&#39;s also been great to reaffirm that the committee understands what the deliverables at the time of the defense will look like, and that they still find that outcome satisfies the requirements of a dissertation in my department. Once I find a meeting time that works for everyone, I send them an agenda for what I&#39;ll cover in the meeting; this helps me use their time wisely, as well as let them know the type of feedback I&#39;m seeking or any questions I might need them to answer (e.g. I let them know I&#39;d be checking if they still felt my deliverables worked as a full dissertation, so they can revisit my project beforehand and come to the meeting prepared with any questions or concerns). To make getting prepared for the meeting easier, I&#39;ll also share a GoogleDoc highlighting what I&#39;ve accomplished since our last meeting; how my project, timeline, or expected deliverables have changed (if at all); and a list of linked titles for the blogs I&#39;ve published since the last meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evaluation at the end of the dissertation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s how I&#39;m tracking my work throughout the dissertation, but how do you establish when a non-traditional dissertation fulfills the normal checks on dissertation completion—has the project demonstrated the ability to design and pursue a scholarly research project at the doctoral level? If you parallel the dissertation with the tenure-application process, you increase the amount of available reading about digital humanities research evaluation. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mla.org/guidelines_evaluation_digital&quot; &gt;guidelines like the MLA&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; for digital projects, the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities&#39; resource page on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdrh.unl.edu/articles/promotion&quot; &gt;Promotion &amp; Tenure Criteria for Assessing Digital Research in the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanities.unc.edu/resources/valuing-evaluating-dh-practice&quot;&gt;Carolina Digital Humanities Initiative&#39;s resource page&lt;/a&gt; on &quot;Valuing and Evaluating DH Practice&quot;. Digital humanities scholars who seek tenure are publicly blogging about their &lt;a href=&quot;http://quintessenceofham.org/2013/02/07/a-digital-humanities-tenure-case-part-2-letters-and-committees&quot;&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; more often, and tips about packaging for tenure review blog posts, tweets, and other examples of scholarly public engagement are frequent among digital humanists on Twitter. Just as tenure applications are starting to include ways scholars have engaged the public, keeping track of online reactions to your project (blog post reading stats, Twitter comments, and RTs for tweets about your dissertation) can serve as a testament to the meaningfulness of your research and dissertation format, as well as offer a kind of shallow mid-stage peer review (thinking along the lines of: retweets of links to posts about your project may be an extremely mild and imprecise form of peer review).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Infinite Ulysses Technical Update: Summer 2014</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/23/infinite-ulysses-technical-update-summer-2014"/>
   <updated>2014-09-23T07:55:59-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/23/infinite-ulysses-technical-update-summer-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The core functionality of my website is the ability to highlight pieces of the Ulysses text and leave annotations on them (questions/answers, interpretations, contextualizations, notes); to achieve this, I&#39;m building off &lt;a href=&quot;http://annotatorjs.org&quot;&gt;Annotator.js&lt;/a&gt;—Javascript code that lets you do what I just described, with a variety of plugin code that lets you add neat features like a heatmap of where the most annotations appear on a text (e.g. on what pages did readers have the most questions? what pages had the most contentious interpretations?). Since the site itself is built with Drupal, I&#39;m using the Drupal modules already built to let Annotator.js work with, for example, Drupal&#39;s database as the place to store readers&#39; annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not as easy as it sounded (is it ever?)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/tagstoragecrossbones.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;That is the Drupal log under the skull and crossbones.&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the Drupal logo under the skull and crossbones. This was on my home dry-erase board for a while...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original project plan was to spend a lot of time coding the look and behavior of the reading interface, with the site functionality not re-inventing various wheels, but instead making connections among existing sets of code that allow textual annotation and social commentary, voting, ranking, etc. In practice, the existing Drupal-module versions of Annotator.js are buggy. Two big examples (for me):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Drupal Annotation modules (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/annotation&quot; &gt;Annotation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/annotator&quot; &gt;Annotator&lt;/a&gt;) don&#39;t store tags added to annotations, so any tags added by a reader disappear forever on refreshing or changing the page (and tags really need to be treated as entities in their own right, and tied into the core Drupal taxonomy); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code that sets up an individual textual annotation to be an &quot;entity&quot; (a Drupal type of content—such as a blog post, book page, or comment—that other existing Drupal modules automatically know how to act on) isn&#39;t completely working either (e.g. you can&#39;t add fields—such as a field to add tags to an annotation, fixing the tag storage problem—with the current code).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having everything &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go as smoothly as planned was actually great, though! I had a realistic goal in terms of what I needed to get done by the end of the summer to stay on track (have the site&#39;s main functions almost all working, ready to be completely finished at the end of September), and I wasn&#39;t worried about doing different work than expected to achieve those goals. Having the Drupal annotation modules need more work than expected meant I got to spend the summer trying various things to solve these issues, and learning a lot in consequence—like creating non-basic custom Drupal entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I learned how to make a custom entity fieldable (able to have fields, like a place where you can add tags and have them autocomplete if they match existing tags) and add some fields to it, both by writing code (&quot;programmatically&quot;) as well as via the Drupal admin interface (after making the annotation visible to the core Field UI module). I also read through the Annotator code so many times that I became much more comfortable with it, so I&#39;ll be able to augment it in the future far more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it looks like I&#39;ll be building off the code fix created by another DH developer who was kind enough to start an online conversation with me about our mutual work improving textual annotation in Drupal (more on that project once they&#39;ve decided to make their code public). I went back and forth about whether I wanted to build off their solution or keep hacking at my own, but in the end I hadn&#39;t been expecting to need to make those code fixes in the first place, so I decided I&#39;d keep my remaining coding time this year free for expected work with the actual reading interface, like making a heatmap of the annotations and porting other existing Javascript/Coffeescript plugins to work with the Drupal version of Annotator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other summer work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/BlogSnap1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screengrab of many many tabs open across the top of my browser.&quot; width=&quot;1343&quot; height=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screengrab of many many tabs open across the top of my browser. A fairly normal view when I&#39;m coding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patching. &lt;/strong&gt;I submitted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/2329271&quot; &gt;extremely simple patch&lt;/a&gt; to the Drupal Annotation module (fixing a misspelled variable) as a way of learning the process; my patch was accepted into the module. Now I know how to create patches when I want to share further work with others using Drupal Annotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installation profiles. &lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;m currently working on two separate local versions of the Infinite Ulysses website: one to work on improving the Annotation function code, and one for work on everything else (e.g. user profiles, site content, theming). As I work on the site&#39;s annotation abilities, I fairly often want to reinstall the site as a slightly quicker alternative to weeding all the references to annotation code out of the database (I should set up uninstall hooks to do this for me eventually...), or to see whether the code works correctly when installing the modules into a new site. Keeping the annotation work on a separate site lets me do this without losing my other work on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! I don&#39;t want to start from a standard Drupal blank site every time I need to reinstall my annotation code; I want a sample page of Ulysses to test the code on, user permissions already set up, modules installed, and various other things configured that I&#39;d rather not do manually every time I reinstall the site. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/developing/distributions&quot; &gt;Installation profiles&lt;/a&gt; are a way to avoid starting from square one with a Drupal site, instead automatically pre-configuring the site as you&#39;d like it to be (think of it like a module that tells the site to configure and install things a certain way during the site installation process). When I visit install.php, I now have a &quot;Infinite Ulysses Pop-Up&quot; option in addition to standard or minimal Drupal installations. Eventually, this profile will turn into a distribution, such that anyone can use it to install a Drupal site pre-configured to act as a participatory digital edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotation sidebar. &lt;/strong&gt;The Annotator.js code I&#39;m working with displays annotations as pop-ups hovering over the text, but from experience with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com&quot; &gt;UlyssesUlysses&lt;/a&gt; prototype and usability research, I prefer having annotations authored and displayed in a sidebar. This will also be handy for the tablet version of the website, as you&#39;ll be able to slide the annotation sidebar off and on the page like a drawer. I&#39;ve been playing around with a couple ways of achieving this: modifying &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/habeanf/annotator/blob/master/src/plugin/marginviewer.coffee&quot; &gt;this existing CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/albertjuhe/annotator_view&quot; &gt;this extension of that code&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ec2-54-191-181-65.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3060/annotation/mary/demo.html&quot; &gt;demo&#39;d here&lt;/a&gt;) to work with Drupal, creating the sidebar by resetting the current CSS on annotation pop-ups and styling them into a sidebar, or a tactic such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artaphis/annotator_comments&quot; &gt;this repo&lt;/a&gt; which purports to display annotations as Drupal comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book-page styling.&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve been vacillating a bit as to the final display structure of the novel: I&#39;m pretty sure I either want to have one page per chapter of the book and infinite scroll to put all the text of a chapter on one page, or have separate pages to match up with each page of the 1922 text of the novel (which I&#39;m using). This is something I might end up doing A/B testing on, showing the text to some visitors one way and to other visitors the other way, and comparing their reactions and stats such as time spent on the site. Here are some questions I&#39;ll need whatever solution I use to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many annotations can load on a page at a time? How does this limit or non-limit affect site speed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do annotations load on a very long page that only loads partial sections of the text at a time (when they&#39;re scrolled to, i.e. infinite scroll)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will bookmarking on the site work—will a reader&#39;s last visited &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; furthest page in the book be marked as where they should start next, or will users have the option (or necessity) to bookmark one or more pages themselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I do offer one long scrolling webpage per chapter of the novel, can I easily generate bookmarks that jump a reader down to the last line they were reading?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other ways can users chart their progress through the book, such as badges per chapter, or a progress bar for pages read?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if readers want to read it out of order, or only some parts online (and mark parts they read offline as completed)? What if they want to glance ahead without losing the bookmark at where they actually want to pick up reading next?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; I met with the artist and IP lawyer behind the excellent web/iPad comic of Ulysses (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulyssesseen.com&quot; &gt;Ulysses Seen&lt;/a&gt;). We&#39;re all keenly interested in opening Ulysses to more public reading and conversation; they want a way for comic readers to be able to jump from the comic to the text, and I&#39;m also interested in supporting the comic&#39;s readers in enjoying the text—so we&#39;ve been discussing combining our websites into one super-accessible, textual &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; visual Ulysses edition, after I&#39;ve defended my dissertation. This is also a good way for me to think about how I&#39;ll manage hosting costs and moderation effort in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other summer activities&lt;/strong&gt; included lots of reading (as much as I read, I&#39;m always adding more links to my reading list every time I go on Twitter), researching the social modules I want to use on annotations, and drafting site content. In particular, I&#39;ve been looking into how existing communities (especially online ones where people submit text and/or converse) have succeeded in building friendly spaces, self-moderating, creating community guidelines, and fostering an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>User-testing a digital edition: Getting the feedback you need</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Has anyone ever managed to get the type of website feedback they requested? How do you do it? I tend to get grammar, grammar, and typos.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Donahue (@sheepeeh) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheepeeh/status/497374716189872128&quot;&gt;August 7, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about specific questions I want to ask during the user testing for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a title=&quot;Digital Dissertation&quot; href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;my dissertation project&lt;/a&gt;—more specifically, Rachel&#39;s tweet had me thinking about how to describe to user-testing volunteers what kind of feedback I&#39;m seeking.  I came up with some statements that model the types of thoughts users might have that I&#39;d like to know about. For the first phase of beta-testing on my project, I&#39;ll ask testers some abbreviated form of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have one of the following thoughts, or similar? Please elaborate:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I wanted to see ___ but didn&#39;t / couldn&#39;t locate it / stopped looking for it even though it&#39;s probably there&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;This is broken&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;This is cool&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;This could be done better (by ___?)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;This doesn&#39;t work how I expected (and that is good / bad /should be changed ___ way)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Where is ___ again (that I used before&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;This requires too many steps / is hard to remember how to use&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t see how / why I&#39;d use this&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I&#39;d use this ___ way in my reading / teaching / work&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I gave up (where, when)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;____ would make me like this site / like it better / use it regularly&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not interested in &lt;i&gt;Ulysses&lt;/i&gt;, but I&#39;d like to use this interface for a different novel / non-fiction text / (other thing)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Starting to read the text on the site took too long (too much to learn / too much text or instruction to wade through) / took the right amount of time (intro text and instruction was appreciated or easily skippable, or site use was intuitive enough to get started)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I would recommend this site (to x person or y type of person)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;The problem with this site is ___&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Reading on this site would be easier if ___&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I wish you&#39;d add ___&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Testing stages for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I start to get all my design and code ducks in a row for this project this month, I&#39;ll be moving into a cycle of user-testing and improving the website in response to user feedback. I&#39;ll be testing in four chunks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-testing:&lt;/strong&gt; Working through the site on my own to locate any really obvious issues; for example, I&#39;ll step through the entire process of signing up and reading a chapter on the website to look for problems. I&#39;ll step through the site with &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2013/12/12/iuusabilitypersonasandsitecontent&quot;&gt;different user personas in mind&lt;/a&gt; (imitating the different backgrounds and needs of some of my target audiences, such as first-time readers of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; and teachers using the site with a class). I&#39;ll also apply various website assessment tools such as validators for code and accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha testing:&lt;/strong&gt; Next, I&#39;ll run some low-stakes testing by inviting my dissertation committee, close friends, and family to break the site. This might get me to a point where the next stage of testers aren&#39;t hitting any problems big enough to take the site down or make testers wait while I take days to fix a difficult issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta testing: &lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;ll conduct beta-testing this fall and spring by opening the site to exploration and use by the people who have generously volunteered &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/qtcy6&quot; &gt;via this sign-up form&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Phase I&lt;/em&gt; will take place this fall and take feedback from volunteers using the site individually; &lt;em&gt;Phase II&lt;/em&gt; will take place in winter and early spring, continuing individual use of the site, and adding in people using the site in groups, such as teachers with their classes, or book clubs reading together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-release testing: &lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;ll continue to take feedback once the site goes live for use by anyone in June 2015, although I&#39;ll need to scale down work on requested enhancements and focus on bug fixes and continued data gathering/analysis on how people use the site to read. Setting up site logging and Google Analytics on my site will help me monitor use as time allows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;User testing how?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be building on my user-testing experience from my master&#39;s research and the &lt;a title=&quot;Bitcurator: Digital Forensics in the Archive&quot; href=&quot;&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/08/26/bitcuratordigitalforensics/&quot;&quot; &gt;BitCurator&lt;/a&gt; project, as well as trying some new tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380&quot; &gt;thesis for my information master&#39;s degree&lt;/a&gt; involved a use study exploring how members of the public (and others with a content interest in a website, but lack of experience with digital humanities and edition/archives commonplaces) experienced scholar-focused DH sites, using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blakearchive.org/blake&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blake Archive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitmanarchive.org&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whitman Archive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as examples. I was particularly interested in identifying small design and development changes that could be made to such sites to better welcome a public humanities audience. For my master&#39;s research, I built off existing user study metrics from a related field (learning technology) as well as creating and testing questions suggested by my research questions; feedback was gathered using a web survey, which produced both quantitative and qualitative data for coding and statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m hoping to further set up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web surveys for willing site visitors to fill out after using the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shorter web pop-up questions—only for users who check a box agreeing to these—that ask quick questions about current site use (perhaps incentivized with special digital site badges, or with real stickers if I can get some funding for printing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-person meetings with volunteers where I observe them interacting with the site, sometimes having them talk aloud to me, or with a partner, as to their reactions and questions as they use the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various automated ways of studying site use, such as Google Analytics and Drupal site logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For bug reports and feature requests, site visitors will be able to send me feedback (either via email or a web form) or submit an issue to the project&#39;s GitHub repository. All bugs/enhancement feedback will become GitHub issues, but I don&#39;t want to make users create a GitHub account and/or figure out how to submit issues if they don&#39;t want to. I&#39;ll be able to add a label to each issue (bug, enhancement request, duplicate of another request, out of scope for finishing my dissertation but a good idea for some day, and won&#39;t fix for things I won&#39;t address and/or can&#39;t replicate). I&#39;m using Zapier (a If This Then That -like service) to automate sending any issues labeled as bugs or enhancements that I want to fix before my dissertation defense to Basecamp, in an appropriate task list and with a &quot;due in x days&quot; deadline tacked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;User testing for the long haul&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got one major technical concern about this project (which I&#39;ll discuss in a later post), and one big research-design concern—both related to the &quot;Infinite&quot;-ness of this digital edition. My research design concern is the length of this user-testing; I&#39;m pursuing this project as my doctoral dissertation, and as such I&#39;m hoping to defend the project and receive my degree in a timely manner. Usability testing can be done over the course of a few months of users visiting the site and my iterating the design and code; testing use and usefulness, as in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how people want to use the site (i.e. perhaps differently from how I imagined),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how people read &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; (a long and complex book which, if you&#39;re not attempting it in a class or book club, might take you months to read), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what happens to a text like &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; as it accrues readers, their annotations, and the assessment the social modules lets readers place on others&#39; annotations (the more readers and annotations, the more we can learn)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are things I can begin to gather data on, and begin to speculate on what trends that data suggests we&#39;ll see, but I won&#39;t be able to give them the full treatment of years of data gathering within the scope of the dissertation. To address this, I&#39;ll both analyze the data I do gather over the course of months of user testing, and try to automate further data-gathering on the site so that I can supplement that analysis every few months or years without requiring too much effort or funding to sustain this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Getting Digital Humanities Done: Schedule, Software, Etc. for a Digital Dissertation</title>
   <link href="/2014/09/09/howthedhsausagegetsmade"/>
   <updated>2014-09-09T08:20:13-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/09/09/howthedhsausagegetsmade</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Attending the Scholars&#39; Lab/NEH &lt;a href=&quot;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speaking in Code&lt;/em&gt; symposium&lt;/a&gt; emphasized for me how much of a research developer&#39;s work involves tacit knowledge, and this opacity extends to scholars in general when it comes to how stuff—books, articles, projects—get made. You get semi-polished glimpses of a work becoming itself, from its beginnings (grant applications, abstracts) to the draft stage (actual drafts, as well as blog posts and conference talks feeling out the research) to the end point (white papers, finished products, and sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/15/llc.fqu026.abstract&quot; &gt;honest discussions of a project&#39;s struggles&lt;/a&gt;). But what does doing this work look like on a daily basis?  What tools do you use, and where, and when? &lt;a href=&quot;http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/on-tradecraft-and-track-changes&quot;&gt;Matthew Kirschenbaum writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;&gt;Nobody teaches you how to write a book. Yes, in graduate school, you may get “feedback” on your dissertation to a greater or lesser extent from mentors and peers. But that typically has very little do with the process of executing on a marketable book project. (Kirschenbaum, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/on-tradecraft-and-track-changes&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/on-tradecraft-and-track-changes&quot;&gt;Kirschenbaum&#39;s post&lt;/a&gt; attempts to improve on this lack of example for how scholarly work gets done, discussing practical details of his book-writing process such as citation management. I&#39;ve tried to emulate this example-sharing by blogging about my dissertational process, from the technical choices I&#39;ve made to the theoretical questions I&#39;m considering. In this post, I&#39;ve asked myself what I&#39;d like most like to learn about others&#39; DH work set-up, and decided that the physical and screenspace environments, most-used software and websites, and work habits were the aspects I would most benefit from seeing other examples of. I&#39;ll describe the workplace set-up, schedule, and software that help me make progress on my &lt;a title=&quot;Digital Dissertation&quot; href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot; &gt;&lt;em&gt;digital dissertation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project and its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, with the hope of hearing more from others about the day-to-day environment and behavior that produces their digital humanities work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Workspace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MITH. &lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;m in residence at MITH as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/mith-welcomes-amanda-visconti-as-winnemore-fellow&quot;&gt;Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow&lt;/a&gt; this academic year, and the plan is to do most of my remaining dissertation work at the office. MITH is generally either quiet or has a pleasant hum, but sometimes I&#39;ll block out sounds while I&#39;m blogging or on a particularly frustrating problem. I saved up for some noise-canceling headphones, which are pretty magical at producing quiet even when I&#39;ve been trying to work in an airport. In the past, I&#39;ve used cheaper but still useful alternatives such as earplugs or normal headphones playing free white noise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coffitivity.com&quot;&gt;Coffitivity&lt;/a&gt; is great when you want want something a little more realistic in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse, both for the extra screen space and to position everything at the optimum height for my wrists and neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/mithwinnemoredesk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo of my fellowship desk at MITH, Fall 2014.&quot; width=&quot;474&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home. &lt;/strong&gt;I worked entirely at home over the summer, but my set-up there is pretty similar (external monitor, desk/chair/externals adjusted to promote good posture/happy muscles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of screen space usage, I&#39;ll have one Chrome browser window open with a number of tabs up (or two separate windows if I want to separate research/question-solving from website work), as well as a minimized Firefox window (for checking site design and script using the plugin Firebug). I&#39;ll also have a text editor open with several different code files I&#39;m working on or consulting, and the GitHub for Mac application open for committing (saving/uploading) new code to my private dissertation code repository (to be made public soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time. &lt;/strong&gt;I have the most energy in the morning; I was the kind of person who preferred taking classes in the 8am slot during college. Being up early lets my day start at a slow pace, and I have a bit of time by myself to get into a good working frame of mind and plan what I want to accomplish that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get to MITH a little before 8 A.M. and stay until I hit a good stopping point for the day, either mid- or late afternoon. I do this for four consecutive days a week, with some extra email/organization/reading work on those evenings after I go home and try to jog. On the remaining three days, I try to do nothing related to the dissertation, focusing instead on fun projects (creating a new theme for this blog, learning to bake really good bread, trying to increase my running distance, learning Go). So far, this is a great schedule: I get way more done than if I try to say &quot;I should be working on my dissertation 40+ hours a week and on every single day!&quot;, and I&#39;m always refreshed and excited to get back to my research after a few days resting my brain with other things. I think I&#39;d allow myself to work on one of these days off if I was really excited, but I never want to feel like I need to; getting my project done a bit sooner isn&#39;t worth burning out or not being able to think about anything but my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduling tasks.&lt;/strong&gt; I previously used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper&quot; &gt;TaskPaper&lt;/a&gt;, a task list app from the makers of the distraction-free writing app &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom&quot; &gt;WriteRoom&lt;/a&gt; (which really helped with writing my candidacy exam presentation!), to keep track of what I needed to do on my dissertation. That got a bit unwieldy. I&#39;ve recently switched to keeping a TaskPaper list for things I want to do on non-dissertating days (so I can write them down and not have them distracting me), and using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Basecamp.com&quot; &gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; to manage teaching and research tasks. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trello.com&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; is a good, free alternative, but I ended up finding the set-up for Basecamp matched the structure of my task list a bit better (I&#39;m also more used to Basecamp from using it for MITH projects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Basecamp, I&#39;ve attempted to break down everything I need to do in the remaining year (knock on wood) of my dissertation into small tasks, then added a date to the tasks I want to complete in the next month, so I can filter to a view of just what I need to accomplish today or this week in order to stay on track. Checking off tasks is pretty gratifying, and having a clear overview of what needs to be done by what point (after first, of course, creating a project timeline that I could reasonably follow, with a lot of empty buffer time at the end for all the things I can&#39;t plan for) keeps me from getting stressed about what I haven&#39;t done yet—if I complete the tasks I need to do this week this week, I know I&#39;m on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a given week, I try to vary between coding-focused days and other activities such as organization of tasks and URL bookmarks, blogging, and reading/research. I generally start the week with coding so that if a problem proves frustrating, I can switch to a non-code day to clear my mind before trying to figure out the issue again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citations. &lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;ve managed citations in the past with the free and awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. for my master&#39;s thesis), and I expect to do so again once I start creating &lt;a title=&quot;Designing a digital scholarly article&quot; href=&quot;/2014/03/31/html5scholarlyarticle&quot; &gt;my final article about my project&lt;/a&gt;. If you do a lot of your research on the Web, Zotero is fantastic—you can use it to pull citation info from a page you&#39;re reading, as well as take a snapshot of the page in case it disappears later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research for me right now means a mixture of theoretical articles (e.g. papers about the social reception of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, or studies on meaningful crowdsourcing for the humanities, or blog posts), example digital editions and other digital textual work (e.g. Alan Galey&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/index.html&quot; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Visualizing Variation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and support for my research coding/design (e.g. code snippets, the Drupal &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;StackExchange&lt;/a&gt;, tutorials, and documentation). I initially saved these bookmarks into various folders, but the folder names at the start of my project proved to be way too vague and all-encompassing two years down the road (&quot;Scholarly Sources to Read&quot;, anyone?). I recently re-organized these so it&#39;s easier to find what I need, with more specific folder titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IUbookmarks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Chrome bookmarks menu with folders for various dissertation topics&quot; width=&quot;401&quot; height=&quot;457&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to keep the folders in a certain order, but kept losing that when I&#39;d sort their contents by title—thus the numbering per folder. In my research resources folder, you can see some more specific sub-folders, such as one where I&#39;m keeping track of the various digital edition and textual annotation tools I considered and tested before ending up working with Annotator.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding.&lt;/strong&gt; I read, edit, and write code in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit&quot;&gt;bbEdit&lt;/a&gt; (the pro version of the free &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler&quot;&gt;TextWrangler&lt;/a&gt;), which has far more fancy features than I can regularly use. Features I&#39;ve found useful include scripts that convert minified CSS and JS into readable, well-structured code; folding (collapsing) sections of a code file I&#39;m not working on and don&#39;t need to see; and searching across multiple folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track changes. &lt;/strong&gt;Keeping track of changes in my code is important for several reasons: I want to document effort for my dissertation committee (especially as my dissertation looks different than those they&#39;re used to), give proper credit and correct licensing for any pieces of open-source code I build on, and be able to roll back my code to an earlier state if I need to. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; to do this, mostly through the website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.GitHub.com&quot; &gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and a GUI app (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mac.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub for Mac&lt;/a&gt;) that is quicker for me than using git on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/306267&quot; &gt;Drupal installation profiles&lt;/a&gt; after I make major changes to my work, so I can easily re-create my site without needing to reset all the options and reinstall various modules; eventually, I&#39;ll package all my work as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/developing/distributions&quot; &gt;Drupal distribution&lt;/a&gt;, so that anyone can spin up a participatory digital edition website like mine with no more trouble than setting up a vanilla Drupal website (and if setting up a vanilla Drupal website is difficult or unknown to you, I&#39;ll provide user-friendly instructions on that as well—or you can check out Quinn Dombrowski&#39;s awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.forhumanists.org&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drupal for Humanists&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command line and local work. &lt;/strong&gt;I don&#39;t use the command line as much when I&#39;m just working locally (i.e. on a version of the website that lives on my computer and isn&#39;t accessible on the Web), and I&#39;ve been mostly working locally lately. When I need it, I use Mac&#39;s Terminal app to manage things that are easier to do from the command line than via the GUI, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/drush-ops/drush&quot; &gt;Drush&lt;/a&gt; (a set of commands that makes doing sysadminy and developer things with a Drupal site quick), or to move files around. When I&#39;m working on a site on the Web, I use the command line to install things, edit files, and more. When I want to work locally on my Drupal site, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro&quot;&gt;MAMP Pro&lt;/a&gt; (the paid version of the free MAMP), which imitates the things I&#39;d be using on a web server to make a Drupal site work (e.g. MySQL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical support. &lt;/strong&gt;An important piece of tacit understanding we discussed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org&quot;&gt;Speaking in Code&lt;/a&gt; was the ability to successfully search for answers to technical problems; surprisingly, knowing how to Google well as a coder—especially when technical words have alternative popular meanings—is a difficult skill to impart. Since someone has probably encountered the same or a similar problem to yours before and written about it, and coding today is all about not re-inventing the wheel but building off of existing open-source code, knowing how to search for what you need is a vital technical skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been working on some of the core functionalities of my Drupal site lately (things related to highlighting and annotating text in a digital edition), so my main searches have to do with Drupal, PHP (which Drupal is largely written in), and Javascript (the core functionality of my site is provided by Annotator.js). Besides pure Googling when I hit an obstacle, I visit the Drupal.org module pages for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/annotator&quot; &gt;Annotator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/annotation&quot; &gt;Annotation&lt;/a&gt; as well as their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/annotator?categories=All&quot; &gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/annotation?categories=All&quot; &gt;queues&lt;/a&gt; (to see if anyone else has run into the same issue), and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Drupal Answers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://serverfault.com&quot;&gt;Server Fault&lt;/a&gt; Q&amp;A sites. I&#39;m also on the Annotator.js list-serv, which is fairly low traffic and offers a mix of news about the community of Annotator users/developers, and developer questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogging. &lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;ve covered how I figured out what I needed to blog about in &lt;a title=&quot;Affinity of ideas: Using an affinity wall to map out my digital dissertation&quot; href=&quot;/2014/04/28/affinitywallarticle&quot;&gt;this post on affinity mapping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Designing Digital Editions: Inclusivity vs. the Literary Canon</title>
   <link href="/2014/05/27/inclusivityeditioncanon"/>
   <updated>2014-05-27T07:30:47-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/05/27/inclusivityeditioncanon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m designing my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; digital edition website (part of my now completed &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities dissertation&lt;/a&gt;) toward including readers usually left out of critical discussions of complex texts through participatory design. One result of that thinking has been discovering multiple ways to define and address &quot;inclusivity&quot;: inclusivity as web design that is universally accessible to users; as invitation to participation; as scaffolding to make a site not only welcoming, but usable by new community members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project is, at its core, about designing interfaces for meaningful conversations around difficult texts. I&#39;ll be learning some things about my sample text &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; along the way (what actually happens to Joyce&#39;s hypertext when it becomes digitally hypertextual and hyper-annotated?)—and using &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; as my example text is crucial to my project&#39;s success (as I&#39;ll explore more below)—but my intervention is one of inclusivity through interface design, rather than at the level of scholarly editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll talk about whether what I&#39;m making is a &quot;scholarly digital edition&quot; in a future post (short answer: no and yes and it&#39;s complicated). Traditionally, scholarly edition work focuses on establishing for other scholars a reliable text prepared according to a rigorous methodology that intervenes at the level of textual paragraphs, words, and characters, and that isn&#39;t what I&#39;m doing in this project. That&#39;s obviously not to say I&#39;m presenting an unreliable text, but that my critical work and argument are bound up in the interface framing a text, and not on the level of the words on the pages (I&#39;m using the text prepared by the Modernist Versions Project and in particular digitized by Matthew Kochis and Patrick Belk.). Although I&#39;m departing from the usual set of scholarly actions in my edition work, instead focusing on designing for participation and exploring different categories of literary annotation, my digital edition does become part of the works making up our digital edition canon—and as such, I wanted to spend some time thinking about how this project of mine might be more inclusive as regards what authors and works are represented in the digital canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A quick overview of digital texts and canonization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JessicaDeSpain&quot;&gt;@jessicadespain&lt;/a&gt; notes only 11/86 projs funded by NEH Preservation &amp;amp; Access in 2006-2011 had a topic other than a white male writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/nmalh?src=hash&quot;&gt;#nmalh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ryan Cordell (@ryancordell) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryancordell/status/409050747666706432&quot;&gt;December 6, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in reading more about canon-formation—particularly in regard to the role authors&#39; race plays in what makes it into the canon—I strongly recommend Amy Earhart&#39;s piece &quot;Can Information Be Unfettered? Race and the New Digital Humanities Canon&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/16&quot;&gt;available in &lt;em&gt;Debates in DH&lt;/em&gt; online&lt;/a&gt;). Earhart provides a fantastic overview of the canon as it has applied to digital text projects past and present, as well as how canon-awareness might shape our future work: &quot;the narrow digital canon should remind us why we cannot stop digital edition work&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding on the digital text examples Earhart names, some digital editions for authors who are not cis male, white, and English-language from the top of my head plus a quick Googling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wwp.brown.edu&quot;&gt;The Women Writers Project&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;a long-term research project devoted to early modern women&#39;s writing and electronic text encoding&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orgs.muohio.edu/anthologies/FMN&quot;&gt;Forget Me Not Hypertextual Archive&lt;/a&gt;: an archive of literary annuals, where the majority of authors were women&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/poetess&quot;&gt;The Poetess Archive&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;works by and about writers working in and against the &#39;poetess tradition,&#39; the extraordinarily popular, but much criticized, flowery poetry written in Britain and America between 1750 and 1900... written in what came to be designated an &#39;effeminate&#39; style, whether written by men or women&quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nl.ijs.si/e-zrc/index-en.html&quot;&gt;eZISS&lt;/a&gt;: Scholarly Digital Editions of Slovenian Literature (found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmgLcm5jfVhSdGlPNm1WQ0hRYjFTU1E5QnBDdlZMQWc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0&quot;&gt;AroundDH Global List&lt;/a&gt; of DH Projects and Centers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more examples (though never enough), but there is no perfect central resource for discovering all digital editions, archives, and literary engagements on the web—something that makes awareness of just what kind of digital canon we&#39;re constructing difficult. Greta Franzini has made an amazing start toward such a resource with her &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag9fg4mfdAuPdHF2Y0twOVpaYS1MbjVWY25UNFZYWFE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0&quot;&gt;Digital Edition Catalogue&lt;/a&gt; (some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.academia.edu/2482066/A_catalogue_of_digital_editions&quot;&gt;slides on the project here&lt;/a&gt; state that one of her findings about digital edition coverage is that it&#39;s Anglocentric). If some DH body with high international visibility (ACH? ADHO? DH Commons?) were to create a way for digital editors to add to this catalog from their main website, I could see this being an ongoing and thorough resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why is &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; a problem? Why is it a solution?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with doing a digital text project around &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is just the (perhaps obvious?) one: it&#39;s another digital edition around the well-known work of a white Anglo male writer, when the digital text canon already feels biased toward authors fitting that description (I&#39;d love to see some stats on this, but again, we&#39;d need to do a good job getting the word out to add any digital texts you know of to the dataset, first). Though the exact degree is uncertain, I expect there is a chilling effect to digital editions of many non-canon authors not existing, not being widely known or used, not being funded, or not being reused by other scholars and read by everyone. The body of DH work out there does say something about our valuing of inclusion: who does DH? who do DH projects focus on? who are DH projects meant to serve? who is welcomed, explicitly and implicitly? what assumptions about intellectual power and authority are invested in our designs? who gets to create a scholarly edition of x canon author? Lindsay Thomas&#39; blog post &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/12/16/open-access-and-the-digital-humanities&quot;&gt;Open Access and the Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt;&quot; reminds us that &quot;making something freely available online does not necessarily guarantee that thing is public, or that it will be used as a public resource&quot;; &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; does not mean participatory, and likewise a project being public, participatory, diverse, accessible, or inclusive does not necessarily mean it also advances any of the other characteristics in that list. This blog post is a way for me to share some of my thoughts on making my project benefit and welcome a wide audience both for using the edition and reusing my code, and solicit feedback on making a better project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a Joycean as well as a textual scholar, and I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s fantastic for me that I can learn things about &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; while building to improve the public humanities. &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is an important text for me personally: it&#39;s why I stayed in an English major despite not enjoying how most of my literature courses were taught; creating a Joyce site was a driving factor behind learning HTML and various digital art skills, which set me on the path to becoming a web developer; it&#39;s how I got into the digital humanities and found a community of people with similar interests (who knew I didn&#39;t need to choose between literature and web development?). How much do I love &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulyssesulysses.com&quot;&gt;This much&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/usurper&quot;&gt;this much&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/fun/marionette.html&quot;&gt;this much&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s unclear to me, however, whether I&#39;d be building a site around &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;—or any other text that&#39;s already comfortably in the canon and public view—if my project didn&#39;t call for a very specific type of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good intellectual reasons for creating a participatory digital edition of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;: I&#39;ve discussed precedents to a participatory digital editions of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/27/infinite-ulysses-background&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and some of the scholarly questions designing, building, and testing such a site can help me explore &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these scholarly questions could be explored with other texts, though. For example, a participatory edition of Djuna Barnes&#39; &lt;em&gt;Nightwood&lt;/em&gt; could help me explore how hypertextualizing/hyper-contextualizing already-hypertextual Modernisms affects the text, but I&#39;d run up against copyright issues that &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; no longer faces (Well, the 1922 Shakespeare and Co.&#39;s public domain status in the U.S. is &quot;contested&quot;, so that&#39;s not &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; true.), but more importantly I wouldn&#39;t be able to attract enough readers to support the main focus of my research, interfaces for participatory critical discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is special. What other difficult texts are so much in the public consciousness? &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s a play, religious texts are divisive, &lt;em&gt;Finnegans Wake&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; difficult. But &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is difficult enough that everyone&#39;s glad for help in reading it (you&#39;re missing out if you&#39;re not reading some side material to find out about its legal history, interpretation, and context), but reading it is also a reachable goal—a marathon of the mind, if you will. People hold reunions with the book clubs they read &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; with decades ago, tweet their frustration and triumphs during the reading experience, and celebrate a yearly holiday on the day the book is set (mark your calendars! Bloomsday is June 16, a date also important in Joyce&#39;s courting of his partner Nora Barnacle). As such, it&#39;s the perfect text for testing an interface supporting active public conversation around a difficult book:  a book that&#39;s widely known as both difficult and beloved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approach to designing for critical participation hinges on user-testing, as well as a speculative experiment imagining how the site would handle millions of users and annotations. To test the site&#39;s usability and usage by real readers and gain meaningful insight not just into the Infinite Ulysses site, but into how any similarly participatory digital edition might be designed, I need to use a text that people are this excited about reading, that they&#39;ve already heard of but haven&#39;t read (or want to reread)—and I can&#39;t think of another text that fits this need like &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Stokes: It’s very easy to build things, put them online, and assume people will use it.

&lt;p&gt;My research hinges on having my site used, and being able to understand what people want in their reading of a difficult text through that use. The Ransom Center has &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.utexas.edu/culturalcompass/2014/01/20/archivist-declares-medieval-manuscript-fragment-crowdsourcing-project-success/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=archivist-declares-medieval-manuscript-fragment-crowdsourcing-project-success&quot;&gt;shown that the public is interested in participating in a project with a not-radically-popular focus&lt;/a&gt;—identifying medieval manuscript fragments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, 369 images, several conference presentations, and more than 67,000 views later, there’s evidence that crowdsourcing can work with even the most archaic of subjects. Twenty-eight individuals (from amateur enthusiasts to established scholars) contributed to the project by providing input via comments on the Flickr page. A number of other individuals assisted through emails or phone calls. Thus far, 94 of the 116 identifiable fragments have been identified, and nearly 57 percent of those were identified through crowdsourcing (by date, region, or the text itself). —&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.utexas.edu/culturalcompass/2014/01/20/archivist-declares-medieval-manuscript-fragment-crowdsourcing-project-success/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=archivist-declares-medieval-manuscript-fragment-crowdsourcing-project-success&quot;&gt;Micah Erwin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects like &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transcribe Bentham&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the NYPL Lab&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://menus.nypl.org&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&#39;s On the Menu?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://buildinginspector.nypl.org&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building Inspector&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, too, show that public DH is very possible, but these are still fairly few projects with strong institutional backing rather than the work of a single junior scholar; these examples are heartening, but not enough assurance for me to base my project around a text without &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&#39; popular allure. For a site that requires repeated visiting and extensive online reading (Something everyone seems to &quot;know&quot; is unpleasant, but spend all their time doing anyway... I&#39;ll be interested to see via user-testing how much reading online is actually an issue, and whether the iPad/tablet version of the site allows more comfortable reading), &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is a necessary choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I&#39;m doing to make my project more inclusive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my ideas toward making my project more inclusive, for the multiple meanings of the word:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design with first-time readers of the novel in mind. Survey people who&#39;ve read the novel on what tripped them up and what places in the novel were especially hard; focus annotation efforts on places readers identified as where they gave up reading the novel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the interface as intuitive as possible, and test it with visitors who aren&#39;t use to DH or other academic sites to make certain you&#39;re not taking certain navigation commonplaces for granted. Create multiple paths for starting to use the site so that readers can jump right in, read suggestions for site use, or watch a short video tour for the site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welcome use and input from all readers frequently (on the front page, and at greater length on another page) and sincerely (back up the claim that everyone&#39;s contributions to the conversations are important by highlighting contributions from diverse categories of user).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore mechanics for rewarding site use (such as highlighting a user&#39;s annotations for viewing by other readers) based on activity level and depth/quality of content, rather than outside identity (e.g. submissions by &quot;amateur&quot; readers vs. tenured scholars as identified in user profiles) to encourage welcoming conversation about the novel from diverse readers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create safe, private mechanics for asking questions. Make routes for feature requests and bug reporting simple and obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design the site to be as universally accessible as possible given dissertational time constraints. Test the site with various available tools (pa11y, screen readers, grayscale and high contrast color palettes). Research how similarly complex interfaces (e.g. library catalogues) address usability. Use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-public/labels/inclusion%2Fuse%20barrier&quot;&gt;&quot;inclusion/use barrier&quot; label&lt;/a&gt; in the site&#39;s GitHub issues repo to highlight bugs and feature requests that address accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider user privacy (allow pseudonyms? option to keep annotations private? option to make annotations that are questions private?), but make sure any option for privacy doesn&#39;t discourage users from being part of the public conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider a reverse speculative experiment of no one using the site (or people reading but not contributing annotations) so that the site is just as useful for a few lone users (a useful experiment even if many eventually use the site, since the site has to start with someone being the lone user even if super-briefly).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a couple ideas that specifically address inclusivity and the digital text canon of which this project is part (a short list that I hope to lengthen!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The premise of the site—a public, participatory conversation around a complex text—augments canon interpretations of the novel by inviting infinite annotations from diverse readers. I can support this further by creating a reading list resource for readers who want to explore existing interpretations of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, along with highlighting which interpretations have been historically popular, and examples of viewpoints that haven&#39;t yet been a large part of the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document my work and release my code so other scholars can easily spin up a participatory edition on any writer or topic, not just canon ones. Encourage this usage by suggesting complex, conversation-worthy texts outside the canon and in the public domain (especially when there&#39;s already a reliable prepared text freely available for use).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my guide to using the site for teaching, suggest lesson ideas for discussing the issue of canonization of Modernist voices, certain lines of interpretations, and of digital text creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggest possible uses of my code/design work to expand the canon. One model I admire is the &lt;em&gt;Shelley-Godwin Archive&lt;/em&gt;, a participatory scholarly edition site that focuses on a circle of writers, some more and some less canon, creating a site that highlights a network rather than a single author.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tactics from Existing Digital Communities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my work is to repurpose things that are already working in non-scholarly digital communities that handle user-generated text. To that end, a few ideas I&#39;ve drawn from around the Web...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org&quot;&gt;Drupal&#39;s home page&lt;/a&gt; (scroll to the bottom) includes a world map that shows where Drupal community activity is happening (possibly in real/near-to-real time?). It might be welcoming to &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; readers to have some sort of similar reflection of the diversity of the site&#39;s community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My site will include a welcome statement on the front page as well as a longer page discussing inclusivity, the site moderation system, and community behavior. I&#39;ll model these texts on wording from sources like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/#inclusivity&quot;&gt;Speaking in Code website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AdaInitiative/tools/tree/master/conferences/sample-policies&quot;&gt;the Ada Initiative&#39;s sample conference policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/16/speculative-experiment-useful-here-and-now&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve previously discussed&lt;/a&gt; StackExchange&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation&quot;&gt;theory of moderation&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, which grants progressive privileges as your participation on the site increases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users with 15 rep can flag posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users with 2,000 rep can edit any question or answer in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users with 3,000 rep can cast close and open votes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users with 10,000 rep can cast delete and undelete votes on questions, and have access to a moderation dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users with 15,000 rep can protect posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users with 20,000 rep can cast delete votes on negatively voted answers. (Jeff Atwood, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation&quot;&gt;A Theory of Moderation&lt;/a&gt;&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SE&#39;s moderation rules are a great step toward basing community authority on participation, but there are still ways that it could fail at inclusivity;  some who want to take part in the community might not have the time or the internet access to establish commitment this way. I want site visitors to be able to use the full features of the site from their first visit, but I might be able to model some site behavior (e.g. what user content gets automatically highlighted on the front page?) on SE&#39;s plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suggestions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s important to me to make the &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; site as welcoming, supportive, and otherwise accessible as possible, and to more broadly advance how we design and promote public, participatory DH. Have any ideas for &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; or toward making digital editions in general more participatory? Maybe you&#39;ve run into an issue in another digital edition or archive that you&#39;d like to see addressed? I&#39;d added a space for sharing suggestions and requests related to inclusivity and accessibility in my sign-up form for beta-testing the site, but you should now feel free to tweet me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/Literature_Geek&quot;&gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt; with any questions or follow me to hear when the website goes live.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Infinite Ulysses: Spring 2014 Tech Update</title>
   <link href="/2014/05/12/spring-2014-tech-update"/>
   <updated>2014-05-12T07:00:21-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/05/12/spring-2014-tech-update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As spring warms up and I&#39;m rapidly approaching the halfway point for my dissertation, I realized I&#39;ve been blogging basically all theory and design, neglecting a discussion of the tech choices I&#39;ve been making. So: a quick update on the state of the participatory digital edition I&#39;ve been designing and coding! (I&#39;ll blog some more in-depth posts about weekly tech work once summer begins and my full time belongs to the dissertation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a fellowship from my department to work full-time on the dissertation (starting in June). That full-time work (Full time, full time full time—as much as I love my job, can you tell I&#39;m excited to devote the entire week for months to my project?), combined with the good place I&#39;m at with my current tech stack, should result in some significant tasks finished by the end of August; I&#39;ll also be able to meet my goal of beginning alpha testing of the site this September. Additionally, I met with my awesomely supportive dissertation committee at the end of April to make sure we were on the same page as to what dissertation deliverables will look like at the time of my defense next spring, and everything seems to be on track (despite switching the core code off which I&#39;m building the site).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I&#39;ve Been Working On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last sixth months were devoted to wire-framing, blogging and working through every design challenge I could think of encountering, and reading up on existing work with digital editions and the online communities from which I&#39;m drawing social mechanics (Reddit and StackExchange). I also set up an Islandora site on a VPS (virtual private server; like a web host, except in addition to managing your web files you manage the entire server as well), and spent some time customizing that and working with Modernist Commons&#39; digital edition modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Switch to Building Off Annotator.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve moved from basing my site on Islandora plus Modernist Commons, to working on a straight Drupal 7 website (I&#39;m keeping a close eye on developments of Drupal 8 so that I can upgrade the site when 8 takes over); as I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/07/islandorainstallnotes&quot;&gt;in my post summing up what I learned about Islandora set-up&lt;/a&gt;, the Modernist Commons platform is very promising, but relies on several technical requirements that cost a lot of effort to use properly/maintain (e.g. a second database for Fedora in addition to the Drupal database (Fedora in particular was a resource drain in both senses: taking up a lot of memory = paying for more memory on my virtual server.) ) to support features much needed by the digital editing community, but out of scope or not applicable to my current project (Modernist Commons will be great at supporting collections of editions that want to incorporate versioning, TEI, and RDF). Modernist Commons is a great project that I look forward to watching develop, and I encourage anyone interested in developing that type of scholarly edition to get in touch with their team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: I learned some really useful sysadmin-type things, and I&#39;m comfortable with Islandora if I ever need it for a future project. The current tech suite for my project is much better streamlined, only requiring the code needed to run my specific project, making it easier for me to create a generic set of code so that others can easily spin up their own participatory digital edition like mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m now building off the Javascript Annotator code from the Open Knowledge Foundation; there&#39;s already a (limited, slightly buggy, but very useful) implementation of a Drupal module to port this code to Drupal usage and to allow storing annotations in the Drupal database. My goal for this month (May 2014) is to finesse how annotations are stored; they&#39;re already accessible in &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org/project/views&quot; &gt;Views&lt;/a&gt;, but tags aren&#39;t stored with the annotations (meaning that tags you create on annotations are lost with each page refresh) and existing Drupal modules for upvoting and other social mechanics aren&#39;t able to act on the annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summer Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I address those two issues, I&#39;ll be set to spend my summer months (June through August) full-time on site theming, user workflows, and setting up another basic feature of the site: &quot;curated&quot; editions. (I should probably start calling these &quot;custom&quot; editions—I understand how some people have Strong Opinions about the use and misuse of &quot;curation&quot;—but I like the connotation of &lt;em&gt;thoughtful&lt;/em&gt; gathering of annotations the word lends to the feature, so I&#39;m being lazy about my diction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever I end up calling it, the “curation” feature will let users easily toggle on a set of tagged annotations so that custom versions of the edition (just with those tagged annotations) may be shared. For example, a professor could annotate all the appearances of books, letters, and other forms of writing in the text and use this as the basis of a discussion with her students; students could also create their “own” editions singly or in groups, either by presenting an edition with their own collected annotations, or a combination of annotations they’d written and curated from existing annotations on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice thing about ironing out storage issues means that I can start inputting my own annotations of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; and not worry about losing that effort; I&#39;ll also be able to provide a guarantee to early beta testers of the site that any annotations they create will be retained in the official release of the site (even if that means I need to export and import them after further tech changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time reading the docs and trying out several frameworks, from ones I was familiar with (I&#39;ve used earlier versions of Zen and Omega before) and hadn&#39;t heard of before (Aurora):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org/project/omega&quot; &gt;Omega&lt;/a&gt; (too tied into using the GUI to customize the theme for me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/aurora&quot; &gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; (interesting, but not as widely used as Zen and therefore not as well documented)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org/project/zen&quot; &gt;Zen&lt;/a&gt; (accessible, good balance in amount of code and GUI-hand-holding between Aurora and Omega, and something I&#39;ve used before)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m leaning toward building off Zen, but we&#39;ll see how things go as I start to work on mobile theming and figure out how to make the site as universally accessible as possible. In the weeks ahead, I&#39;ll be writing about how I&#39;m incorporating usability and accessibility studies from other domains into my digital edition site design.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Affinity of ideas: Using an affinity wall to map out my digital dissertation</title>
   <link href="/2014/04/28/affinitywallarticle"/>
   <updated>2014-04-28T11:40:37-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/04/28/affinitywallarticle</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram&quot; &gt;affinity wall (diagram, chart)&lt;/a&gt; is a technique I picked up while doing some contextual inquiry consulting as part of my information master&#39;s. It&#39;s a way to take a bunch of separate ideas and visually map out how they&#39;re related (thus, &quot;affinity&quot;); this helps your areas of focus (or paper section headings) rise organically out of an overview of all the things you want to cover, rather than being pushed onto the ideas from the top down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/affinityboard1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The dry-erase board before I started (in the corner are topics I&#39;d need to cover at the end of the project, after user testing).&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;199&quot;&gt; The dry-erase board before I started (in the corner are topics I&#39;d need to cover at the end of the project, after user testing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/44466253@N07&quot;&gt;I first used affinity mapping&lt;/a&gt; to figure out how a system (tech support ticketing software for a nursing department) actually worked, mapping my observations from being embedded in a workplace environment, instead of just relying on interviews and staff views on what they thought was going on. Now, I&#39;m using it to figure out how all the things I want to think about and say as part of dissertation project can come together in one scholarly journal article. (&lt;em&gt;Note that photos are deliberately small, as I&#39;m not completely comfortable with posting a detailed outline of an eventual journal article&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/affinityboard2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post-it notes grouped by topic on the affinity wall dry-erase board.&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;372&quot;&gt; The first grouping of topics on the affinity board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/affinityboard3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A close-up on the topics I drew out of my affinity groupings. Text version at end of post.&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;476&quot;&gt; A close-up on the topics I drew out of my affinity groupings. Text version at end of post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Make an Affinity Wall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique is simple: get a couple packs of post-it notes and an empty wall or board. Write down one idea per post-it, only using a few words (if you need more, you should probably break the thought into more post-it notes); you can use different colors of post-it if you want to keep track of some factor such as whether the idea came from an interview, an observation, a Twitter conversation, or a book. Once you&#39;ve written everything out, start to group things together in ways that make sense, without trying to impose some pre-decided groupings on the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/affinityboard4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The final affinity wall, with post-its grouped by topic and ordered within those topics.&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;354&quot;&gt; The final affinity wall, with post-its grouped by topic and ordered within those topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Affinity Wall to Journal Article&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual dissertation deliverable for this article is only a polished draft; we&#39;re not tying its acceptance or publication into the evaluation process. I&#39;m expecting to write sections that won&#39;t be submitted when I share the piece with a journal, so I tried not to think about whether there would be enough space to cover a topic in the final article; in the paper I share at my defense, I&#39;ll just flag any sections that will drop out before sending the article to a journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affinity wall also covered content I needed to write that wouldn&#39;t fit in even the longest article: things I needed to think through via writing and research, and content I want on the site (e.g. a short background on Joyce and the writing of Ulysses, a moderation policy, and addressing the IP rights of site users). I bracketed on the side of the board any topics that would only appear as written content on the website not in the journal article) or for pieces I could only write after my user testing. This left me with nine main sections of writing and thinking that I can work on right now as I&#39;m building the website. Once those nine topics were chosen, I was able to arrange the post-its beneath the headings in an order that makes narrative sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tackling the Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step will be to mark every post-it that I&#39;ve already begun to address. The point isn&#39;t to cross things off a list once I&#39;ve blogged about them once. Rather, the wall lets me make certain I&#39;m spending time thinking about all the major sections of the project; I mark a post-it note once (one diagonal line across) when I&#39;ve thought and written enough about a topic that I&#39;ve produced a blog post, and twice (making an X across the post-it square) when I&#39;ve done enough work that my writing on the topic is ready for pulling into a draft of the journal article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the nine main sections I ended up with, in case they&#39;re hard to read on the photos (Again, these are deliberately non-zoomable as I&#39;m not completely comfortable with showing the world a detailed outline of an article I&#39;ll be working on for the next year):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lit review and project precedents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculative experiment to practical outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissertation format and methodology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Edition&quot;? (addressing what an edition is and if my website is one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metaphors for participatory editions (e.g. &lt;a title=&quot;Living Editions: What Seminars Can Teach Us About Building Digital Editions&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/06/livingeditions&quot;&gt;my post on classrooms as participatory editions&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inclusivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning from existing online communities (e.g. &lt;a title=&quot;Cat GIFs &amp; Mrkgnao: Ulysses, Reddit, and What Digital Editions Can Learn from Online Communities&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/07/29/redditulysses&quot;&gt;my post on what digital editions can learn from Reddit and StackExchange&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more, &lt;a title=&quot;My Digital Dissertation: Public Humanities, Participatory Design, and Infinite Ulysses&quot; href=&quot;/2014/04/20/my-digital-dissertation-update&quot;&gt;the recent talk I gave at the Nebraska DH Forum&lt;/a&gt; is pretty thorough, or you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot; &gt;see the now completed dissertation project site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&#39;s a transcript of the video:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m designing, coding, and user-testing digital social reading interfaces for my literature doctoral dissertation. This is a novel approach; rather than write the traditional four-chapter monograph, my dissertation will consist of four pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Infinite Ulysses participatory digital edition website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal usability testing with volunteers reading Ulysses via my website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research blogging on the process of scholarly building throughout the entire dissertation, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A multimedia scholarly article&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the site to pursue three main research questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. How can we design digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and non-academics in our love for the nuances of a text’s history and interpretation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (things like upvoting and tagging) to create reading experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of user-generated annotation quantity but also quality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like Ulysses—when a participatory digital edition places them under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s turn to discussing the site itself. Here&#39;s the simple version of what my edition will let scholars and readers do: read the text online on their laptop, iPad, or tablet; when they run into something in their reading, whether that&#39;s a question, or an interpretation or context they wish to share, or an answer for a question left by another reader, they&#39;ll be able to highlight that piece of the text and add that as an annotation, which will then show up to the side of the text (like marginalia). Readers can also add tags to these annotations and up- or down-vote them, as well as have the option to fill out user profiles with fields for research interests, whether you&#39;ve read the text before, and other details to aid in site customization for each reader&#39;s interests, background, and reading habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t read through all the examples what the site will be able to do (you can &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/25/iufeatures&quot;&gt;read a full list on this blog post&lt;/a&gt;), but here are a few examples of things you&#39;ll be able to do on the Infinite Ulysses site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can filter the annotations on the novel to only show those notes on particular areas of interest to you (e.g. annotations that translate foreign words, or annotations aimed at first-time readers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can filter &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; annotations you don&#39;t want to see (e.g. spoilers about something that only becomes clear later in the book)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, you can easily create your own customized reading edition of Ulysses that shows only annotations aimed at a specific topic (e.g. an edition meant for use by a class focusing on the place of books, letters, and other written material in the Modernist novel), and/or only see annotations added by specific users, such as members of your literature class or book club&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A transcript of my talk on digital humanities interface usability and my dissertation from the recent Nebraska Digital Humanities Forum is below, and it&#39;s a great overview of the entire dissertation. For an even quicker overview of my dissertational research, please &lt;a title=&quot;Dissertation Quick Video!&quot; href=&quot;/2014/04/20/dissertation-quick-video&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;check out this three-minute video on my dissertation project!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up? Public Humanities, Participatory Design, and Infinite Ulysses&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(transcript of talk delivered at Nebraska DH Forum 2014)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/newlogo2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Draft of logo for Infinite Ulysses site&quot; width=&quot;409&quot; height=&quot;175&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Draft of logo for Infinite Ulysses site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we build a digital edition and everyone (millions of scholars, first-time readers, book clubs, teachers and their students) shows up and annotates the text with their infinite interpretations, questions, and contextualizations? The “Infinite &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;” project pursues this speculative experiment, and today I&#39;m going to talk about how this unlikely hypothetical is helping me study and improve DH interface usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textual scholar Morris Eaves conceives of editions not just as vessels for textual content, but as “problem-solving mechanisms”; and I&#39;m using this speculative edition experiment to both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;produce something practically useful, designing and coding an actual digital edition of James Joyce&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; with a number of experimental interface features, and then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conducting use and usability testing with real readers and researchers to focus on three interrelated lines of questioning:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. First, a question about how such an experiment can benefit the humanities:&lt;/b&gt; How can we design digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and the lay person in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Second, a question about how we make such a thing as my speculative idea work:&lt;/b&gt; How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (things like upvoting &amp; tagging) to create reading and research experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of user-generated contextual annotation quantity but also quality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. And third, a question about how this interface work affects the texts at its core: &lt;/b&gt;What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;—when a participatory digital edition places them under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Quick Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be discussing how scholarly digital edition development helps us look at these three questions, and I&#39;ll also address how the overall Infinite &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; project functions as an unusually shaped humanities dissertation. Before I go any further, though, I want to define some words I&#39;ll be using a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;&lt;b&gt;digital editions&lt;/b&gt;&quot; I&#39;m talking about are literary or other texts that have been prepared for online reading and research by a scholarly editor according to a carefully constructed interpretation and methodology. These are digital editions like those on the &lt;em&gt;Whitman&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Shelley-Godwin Archives&lt;/em&gt;, rather than the digitized/scanned and non-interpreted texts you find on Google Books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll also be talking about &quot;&lt;b&gt;annotations&lt;/b&gt;&quot; a lot. When a reader &quot;annotates&quot; my digital edition, they&#39;re highlighting a word, phrase, or other section of the literary text, then typing in a comment on that highlighting. This annotation then appears in the margin of the text depending on some other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&#39;ll be talking about &quot;&lt;b&gt;speculative design&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, a design approach that imagines future challenges and opportunities, and builds design solutions both imbued with theoretical innovation and the possibility of future utility. It&#39;s a way of using hypotheticals to make connections you might not otherwise make. My designing a digital edition that could handle a hypothetical public wildly interested in annotating a complex text is a speculative experiment that&#39;s helping me think about customizing annotations to individual researchers, and about how heavy annotation changes an unwieldy text like Ulysses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Participatory, Public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholarly editor Gary Taylor has asked : “How can you love a work, if you don’t know it? How can you know it, if you can’t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” Scholarly editors are an integral part of the continuum that keeps the stories of the past available to and understood by the present—but just as important in Taylor’s formulation is the you, that public of not just scholars, but also readers in and beyond the academy whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsey Thomas notes that &quot;making something freely available online does not necessarily guarantee that thing is public, or that it will be used as a public resource&quot;*. I&#39;m interested in building tools and digital editions that help both textual scholars and the lay person participate in our love for the nuances of a text; and I&#39;m especially interested in how we can use interface design to encourage not just consumption of, but participation in the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of thinking about participatory platforms is as a classroom. What&#39;s the connection between teaching and editions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;[Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman] prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, ‘Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.’ ...Feynman said, ‘I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;But he came back a few days later to say, ‘I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don’t really understand it.‘&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;— David L. Goodstein, in Feynman’s Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how this Feynman quotation expresses that teaching is knowing, that we learn something more intimately when compelled to make our knowledge declarative for others, and if we&#39;re not able to teach a thing, then we might not know it as well as we thought. When I think about designing welcoming digital editions and other digital humanities sites, I often think about how we can make them more like a really good graduate seminar experience, where scaffolded discussion helps you think and discuss better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flip side to the metaphor of a classroom as a participatory space is that many digital editions are kind of participatory once removed. By aiming their content at teachers with things like teaching guides and sample assignments, they do a great job at humanities outreach, but the learning and discussion usually happens off the actual digital project site, and thus doesn&#39;t feed into the experience of other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Participatory Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just discussed a more loose way of thinking about &quot;participatory&quot; design. There&#39;s also a more rigorous definition for participatory design that comes from the field of human-computer interaction (or HCI). HCI, a field focused on interfaces between user and computer (including interfaces of reading and research), provides this useful approach to a humanities that simultaneously benefits the public and scholars. Participatory design is an approach not just centered on the scholar or just on the public, but finessing the “third space” of discussion and shared learning that exists when the two groups come into conversation; Michael Muller has found that results can include “challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal dialogues across and through differences&quot;*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sites and projects are intended &quot;primarily with scholars in mind&quot;, and these are necessary and important contributions to the academy and human knowledge. On the other hand, I feel like non-designers are too quick to repeat the cliched &quot;you can&#39;t design for multiple audiences&quot;, instead of thinking &quot;&lt;b&gt;how do I design for this space where we learn together?&lt;/b&gt;&quot; For example, in a formal usability study of public use of several key digital archives, I found that it was often very simple interface changes users desired in order to be able to understand and use a DH site. When we bring the public into our scholarly conversations, everyone can benefit, and it&#39;s important to remember that designing for interactive participation and pedagogy is itself a scholarly activity that also benefits the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infinite Ulysses: What&#39;s It Going to Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s turn to the Infinite &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; digital edition and how I&#39;m designing it to be participatory. Here&#39;s the simple version of what my edition will let scholars and readers do: read the text online on their laptop, iPad, or tablet; when they run into something in their reading, whether that&#39;s a question, or an interpretation or context they wish to share, or an answer for a question left by another reader, they&#39;ll be able to highlight that piece of the text and add that as an annotation, which will then show up to the side of the text. Readers can also add tags to these annotations and up- or down-vote them, as well as have the option to fill out site profiles with fields for research interests, whether you&#39;ve read the text before, and other details to aid in site customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3485&quot; src=&quot;/assets/IUsimplecycle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The site lets readers add notes and otherwise discuss the text, then uses those notes to make a more customized experience for each reader.&quot; width=&quot;462&quot; height=&quot;508&quot;&gt;The site lets readers add notes and otherwise discuss the text, then uses those notes to make a more customized experience for each reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to demo the site because I&#39;ve been focusing on coding the interface behavior and not on the final theming design yet. The final site won&#39;t look like this, but it&#39;s a general sense of the layout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/InfiniteUlyssesWebDesign1-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old wireframe capturing general layout of site (but not current design work).&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot;&gt;Old wireframe capturing general layout of site (but not current design work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a central column of reading text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a drawer on the right for creating and reading annotations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a drawer on the left for customizing your view of the text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fun Potential Issues with which I&#39;ll Be Dealing!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project combines its speculative design approach with the scholarly primitive of curation (dealing with information abundance and quality and bias), imagining scholarly digital editions as popular sites of interpretation and conversation around a text. Of course, with our hypothetical millions of users and annotations, we can&#39;t display all of them next to the text, and you&#39;d quickly see the entire text covered in a single block of yellow highlighting if we left everything highlighted that ever got annotated. By drawing from examples of how people actually interact with text on the internet, such as on the social community Reddit and the Q&amp;A StackExchange sites, I’m creating a digital edition interface that allows site visitors to create and interact with a potentially high number of annotations and interpretations of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big questions I&#39;m trying to answer with this interface design are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If everyone’s submitting annotations to a digital edition, how can we automate the massive task of curation and moderation so that it occurs in a timely and unbiased manner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And once we’ve separated the wheat of critical yet diverse annotations from the chaff of repetitions, spam, and under-substantiated suggestions, how do we make the still-plentiful remaining material accessible to the users it would best serve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is, how do we separate the signal from the noise when the “signal” of pertinent contextual annotations means different things for different reader needs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project is testing out to what degree using tags, upvoting, and profile information can help customize the reading experience for each reader. The hypothetical here is that we&#39;re able to filter the annotations to match the level of help a person needs, or their research interests; and, when there are still too many annotations available for a given word or phrase, at least cycle randomly through better subsets of annotations than the entire available pool. I&#39;ve been coding to follow what seems to work best for existing successful online communities, including by visiting these communities&#39; spaces for meta-analysis such as the subreddit &quot;theory of reddit&quot;, but we won&#39;t know how well this works with a digital edition until I begin my usability testing this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t read through all the examples of functions I&#39;ve been coding for (&lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/25/iufeatures&quot;&gt;you can read a full list in this post&lt;/a&gt;), but here are a few examples of things you should be able to do with the edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filter the annotations to only show those on particular areas of interest (e.g. annotations that translate foreign words, or annotations aimed at first-time readers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filter out annotations the reader doesn’t want to see (e.g. spoilers about something that only becomes clear later in the book)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easily create a curated “edition” of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; showing only annotations aimed at a specific topic (e.g. an edition meant for use by a class focusing on the place of books, letters, newspapers, and other written material in the Modernist novel), and/or only see annotations added by specific users, such as members of a class or book club&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, will we get enough annotations, tagging, and voting to make the site work? Even if the site doesn&#39;t have many more annotations and tags than the base set provided by me and several contributing scholars, it&#39;ll still be a useful public site. Some years back, I built a prototype non-participatory digital edition of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; that was much simpler, but dealt with similar questions of interface design for ease of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; first-time reading; unfortunately it&#39;s now very technically dated and has a frightening color palette; I still hear from random people around the world that they&#39;ve read its two chapters of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; and want more, though, so I do think there is already a desire for a certain way of presenting &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; online with annotation. I&#39;m really hoping to be able to support a resource that is not only read, though, but also participated in, so that we can hear many more voices in our discussion of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will Readers Tag?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LibraryThing blog has &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/FGJRrC&quot; &gt;a great article on how people tag things for themselves&lt;/a&gt;, not just because a site offers it, for personal reasons like aiding in memory and socializing. LibraryThing has found success with users tagging books, while Amazon&#39;s book tagging feature has failed (I didn&#39;t even know you could tag books!). I choose &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; for my test text in part because it occupies a special position: difficult enough that people welcome help in reading it, yet still very much in the popular consciousness as something that can and should be read (as opposed to, say, Finnegans Wake). People tweet about trying to read &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; all the time, hold reunions with book clubs with whom they read the text in the past, and celebrate the &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; holiday of Bloomsday every June. There&#39;s an audience out there to support with such a site, and I&#39;m expecting that people will use the site&#39;s features in a way that benefits themselves but also others, whether they choose to annotate and tag and vote to interact with people they know offline like book clubs, or want to create a customized annotated edition for teaching or research use, or want to help track clues throughout the book, or otherwise serve the same purpose as sticky notes and penciled marginalia in print books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital Humanities Use and Usability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be conducting both use and usability studies to understand and build from user feedback. Usability is concerned with whether the site lets users simply and intuitively do what the site is meant to do—that is, read &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; and participate in a discussion around it. To study this, I can for example see how much time or how many clicks it takes a user to get to the text and add a question or other annotation. Use is the equally interesting study of how people actually use the site; do they want to tag annotations? do they want to do unexpected things like literary role-playing using the annotations? To some extent, I&#39;ve tried to design for expected &quot;non-official&quot; uses, such as realizing that people would use the annotation feature to ask questions and supporting it both by allowing filtering for questions and answers, and creating a link to a feed of all unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literary Texts under Participation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third question this project is helping me explore is about &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; itself. What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic—under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project builds on previous Joycean contextualizing work: such as Blamire’s Bloomsday Book and Gifford’s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; Annotated. Previous contextualizations (especially those on a higher, more macro-level of understanding the basics of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; rather than specific allusions) carry an increased risk of authorial bias because of their individual authorship (e.g. the Bloomsday Book is very interested in charting Bloom’s development as a Christ figure); while the sources I’ve named are all excellent and useful pieces of scholarship that have improved my enjoyment of the novel, I’m very interested in seeing how a participatory edition might moderate among a variety of higher-level contextual interpretations and whether we might thus prevent a canon of interpretation from calcifying around the text, or at least multiple popular key streams of thinking around the text within the same digital space. &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is also an interesting contextualization problem in that there are many sets of contextualizations floating around the web from both scholars and amateurs (in the old and new senses of the word); I’m interested in bringing diverse sets of interpretation together in one place and seeing how they overlap or contend with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key print precedents for this project are variorum and other editions that deal with a large quantity of variants, marginalia, or other annotation, such as the Shelley-Godwin manuscript notebooks and Hans Gabler’s synoptic &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; edition; these last two examples have convenient digital counterparts in Michael Groden’s never-finished &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; in Hypermedia prototype, and the developing Shelley-Godwin Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ulysses + Hyperannotation = ???&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there isn’t a complete critical digital edition of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; yet published, that hasn’t kept Joycean scholars from anticipating issues that might arise with the eventual migration to digital space. Where the limitations of print space have in the past kept annotations of the text in check, what will happen when a digital platform allows the addition and navigation of infinite annotations? Can we migrate complex print hypertexts such as &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; to a digital space with socially multiplied annotations without, as Mark Marino wonders, “diminish[ing] the force of the book”? Marino asks, &quot;Assuming it were possible, would the creation of a system that automatically makes available all the allusions, unravels all the riddles, and translates foreign languages normalize Joyce’s text?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Attridge similarly sees a risk in &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&#39; hypertextualization and hyperannotation, saying &quot;[&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&#39;] cultural supremacy, and the scholarly efforts which reflect and promote that supremacy, have turned it into a text that confirms us in our satisfied certainties instead of one that startles and defies us and thus opens new avenues for thought and pleasure. It now provides a spurious sense of rich complexity by reducing differences and distinctions&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Attridge also sees space for promise in the digital development of the text, saying &quot;The very magnitude of the encyclopedic Joycean hypertext can itself be unsettling… and it may be possible to produce a hypermedia version of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; that is anything but reassuring—one that revives, in new ways, the provocations and disturbances of the original publication… The best teachers (like the best critics) are those who find ways to sustain the disruptive force of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; even while they do their necessary work of explaining and demystifying&quot;. I&#39;m hoping that by going back to my earlier definition of a participatory edition—one that functions like a classroom—we might be able to collectively make &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&#39; chaotic wonder accessible to more people, without also dampening that wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, despite there being no full digital edition of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; against which to test these fears and assumptions about hypertextualization, we already have some questions about what happens to a complex Modernist text when “everyone shows up”, and I’m hoping that by creating a site that experiments with allowing “infinite” contextual annotation of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, we can get a more realistic picture of what extreme annotation actually does to our experience of the text. When even &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; editor Hans Gobbler says he still learns new things about &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; from time to time, I’m confident that &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; will persist as always partially unfixed, always giving back more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does this work as a dissertation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Infinite &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; digital edition is a dissertational project. In addition to the Drupal edition site, which will include the theme design, module coding in JS and PHP, and incorporated user feedback, the overall project has four other deliverables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public code repository and documentation on using my code to build a similar digital edition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal usability study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular blogging on the technical and theorizing processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scholarly digital article built from the blog posts and the usability study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why this format and these methodologies? My primary field of interest is textual studies, a sub-field within literary studies that concerns itself with the scholarly acts of editing and edition-making, as well as preserving literary texts; more specifically, I’m interested in digital editing, which migrates these traditional scholarly practices to the online world, opening up possibilities for new ways of reading and studying literary texts. Much of the recent activity in textual studies as a discipline has followed this path, as an examination of the program for the annual Society for Textual Scholarship conference would confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that the most productive and efficacious (in terms of scholarly impact) way to push the current research, reading, and teaching capabilities of the digital edition further is to actually demonstrate them in practice, through the hands-on work of designing, building, and testing a digital platform for new editing practices. In many respects, my project is not much different from the previously accepted practice of producing for the literature dissertation a scholarly edition, complete with commentary and editorial apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a field concerned with scholarly editing and edition-making, we need editions that experiment boldly not &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;with the editing of texts, but also with the crafting of those textual frames, treating the edition interface as an argument and meta-text worthy of experimentation and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you enjoyed this post, you might also enjoy the feed of my regular dissertation blogging, including posts on &lt;a title=&quot;Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design &amp; the Urgency of the Public Humanities&quot; href=&quot;/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities&quot;&gt;the public digital humanities via participatory interface design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Thinking Through Making: More Precedents for Scholarly Experimentation as Critical Work&quot; href=&quot;/2013/08/19/scholarlyexperimentation&quot;&gt;precedents for scholarly experimentation as critical work&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&quot;Values&quot; href=&quot;/2013/12/02/valuespost&quot;&gt;how I&#39;m demonstrating my intellectual values via this project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes from an Islandora Installation (aka Islandora Digital Edition Brain Dump)</title>
   <link href="/2014/04/07/islandorainstallnotes"/>
   <updated>2014-04-07T07:00:57-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/04/07/islandorainstallnotes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently spent some time installing &lt;a href=&quot;http://islandora.ca&quot;&gt;Islandora&lt;/a&gt; (Drupal 7 plus a Fedora Commons repository = open-source, best-practices framework for managing institutional collections) as part of my digital dissertation work, with the goal of using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://editingmodernism.ca&quot;&gt;Editing Modernism in Canada&lt;/a&gt; (EMiC) digital edition modules (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_critical_edition&quot; &gt;Islandora Critical Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_critical_edition_advanced&quot; &gt;Critical Edition Advanced&lt;/a&gt;) as a platform for my &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/25/iufeatures&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; participatory digital edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Islandora?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For various reasons having to do with the focus and scope of my particular dissertational project, I didn&#39;t ultimately end up using Islandora or the EMiC modules for my digital edition (e.g. I don&#39;t need the Fedora Commons extra database and collection management abilities to work with my single text, and I need installation to be lightweight and easy so others can replicate my site)—but I spent enough time with them to know they&#39;re fantastic tools for creating an online scholarly collection of critical text- or image-based editions. Here&#39;s some highlights of what Islandora plus the EMiC modules can let you do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload and OCR your texts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batch ingest of pages of a book or newspaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TEI and RDF encoding GUI (incorporating the magic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cwrc.ca/projects/infrastructure-projects/technical-projects/cwrc-writer&quot;&gt;CWRC-Writer within Drupal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight words/phrases of text—or circle/rectangle/draw a line around parts of a facsimile image—and add textual annotations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet Archive reader for your finished edition! (flip-pages animation, autoplay, zoom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fedora-commons.org&quot;&gt;Fedora Commons repository&lt;/a&gt; managing your digital objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Islandora?query=&quot; &gt;Islandora has a slew of active repositories&lt;/a&gt; for additional features, such as integrating Solr search and ingesting web archives, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA712/Solution+Packs&quot; &gt;solution packs&lt;/a&gt; for handling many types of digital object (newspapers, large images, audio, PDFs, video...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I set it up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;d want to start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA712/Islandora&quot; &gt;the Islandora wiki &lt;/a&gt;for both installation instructions and answers as to what Islandora is and what it can do; there&#39;s also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://islandora.ca&quot; &gt;main Islandora site&lt;/a&gt;. Other places to look for help include the main &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora&quot; &gt;Islandora listerv&lt;/a&gt; for Islandora users, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora-dev&quot; &gt;Islandora Dev listserv&lt;/a&gt; (if you&#39;re looking for help in developing on Islandora), and listservs for any particular pieces of the installation process that give you trouble (e.g. I found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fedora-commons.org/community/developers/devlist&quot; &gt;Fedora Commons developer mailing list&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/djatoka/index.php?title=Main_Page&quot; &gt;Adore Djatoka wiki&lt;/a&gt; helpful, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://asingh.com.np/blog/fedora-commons-installation-and-configuration-guide&quot;&gt;this blog post on Fedora set-up&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT FIRST!&lt;/strong&gt; While the Islandora wiki instructions will help you install Islandora on your own server, I&#39;d highly recommend trying two other tactics first—because regular installation requires a lot of sysadminy folderol (fine and great fun if you&#39;re a sysadmin or interested+have the time in picking up some new knowledge in that area). Islandora&#39;s a fantastic platform, but the main problems I ran into while installing and playing with it were server configuration ones: finding the right paths, selecting the right versions of software, setting permissions correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t find that following the wiki straight through resulted in a working site; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; to find fault with the official documentation, though!: documentation is very difficult with a thing like Islandora because many server configs are different, dependencies develop new versions, packages cease to be available (Something I&#39;ve learned from creating user documentation for BitCurator is that we have to write documentation for things not even in our suite of tools or they can be major stumbling blocks to people using our software—stuff like getting 7-zip to decompress a file, or VirtualBox to recognize a given USB stick). The page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA711/Installing+Solr+and+GSearch&quot; &gt;setting up Solr and gSearch&lt;/a&gt; was a particular stumbling point for me and others, and I&#39;d recommend you&#39;d start by reading the comments at the bottom and then doing a quick search on the Islandora listserv when you get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start Here!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I&#39;d strongly recommend playing around with Islandora using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://islandora.ca/downloads&quot; &gt;virtual image&lt;/a&gt; they offer (bottom of the page) to make sure it&#39;s right for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Then, consider forgoing the wiki instruction route for this &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/islandora/mEz2KAgVUs4&quot; &gt;one-click automated Islandora install&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. I haven&#39;t tried it myself (it became available after I&#39;d switch over to plain Drupal 7), but various users have chimed in on that thread that it works, or with questions when they ran into issues (that were quickly answered by the community). You&#39;ll need to learn Vagrant and Chef to make this route work, but that should both &lt;em&gt;a)&lt;/em&gt; be less work than learning how to so the server config stuff you&#39;d need to do for the Islandora install otherwise, and &lt;em&gt;b)&lt;/em&gt; be really great in the long run for your Islandora site (Vagrant lets you not mess with the system configuration on your host computer and quickly deploy a local dev site to the public). Also, it looks like that thread instructs you on the stuff you&#39;d need to learn about Vagrant/Chef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up Islandora without Vagrant or the VM: Random Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to set up Islandora using the wiki instructions (rather than using the Vagrant route mentioned above), I&#39;ve compiled below random notes I took during my set-up process. These are meant as supplementary to the Islandora wiki and listserv and in no way can be followed on their own to set up your site—but it seemed worthwhile to share somewhere as one possible reference if you run into issues while setting up your Islandora site. Caveat emptor: as I mentioned, I&#39;m no longer working on an Islandora site for my dissertation project, so I won&#39;t be able to answer any Islandora-y questions. If you do have any questions specifically about using Islandora for digital edition sites, &lt;a href=&quot;http://editingmodernism.ca/contact-us&quot;&gt;get in contact with the excellent people at Editing Modernism in Canada&lt;/a&gt;, who have been developing the modules to add those editing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Server Set-Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linode.com&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; to set up Virtual Private Server (VPS) with Islandora and was very happy with their services. If you&#39;re used to using regular web hosting, the difference with a VPS is that you have access to a &quot;whole server&quot;, so you can fiddle around with what version of PHP is installed, etc. Linode was not only reliable and fairly-priced, they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.linode.com&quot;&gt;truly amazing documentation&lt;/a&gt; on how to set up your server—so don&#39;t be hesitant over creating your own Islandora site just because you&#39;ve never used a VPS or set up a server before—Linode can walk you through it. Additionally, there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://feross.org/how-to-setup-your-linode&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Feross Aboukhadijeh on &quot;How To Set Up Your Linode For Maximum Awesomeness&quot; to further help you with your Linode set-up. I&#39;d recommend starting by getting a basic Ubuntu 12.04 server set-up by following the Linode instructions (also check out their set of &quot;stackscripts&quot; that automate things like setting up LAMP on your server).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Random Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found it extremely helpful to keep a written log of everything I was doing: things I tried, files I altered, paths to error logs I&#39;d want to be checking, tutorials I&#39;d tried (I also started auto-saving my command line input). I decided to cut a lot of that out for this post because it was very specific to my server config and needs (and also contained some trial and error and exasperated comments...), but I&#39;d strongly encourage you to do the same. I&#39;d never forced myself to keep such thorough notes on what I was doing before, and I&#39;ll be doing it in all my tech work from now on. You&#39;re going to have a million passwords you&#39;ll need to record anyway (Tomcat user, Drupal, Drupal database, Fedora database...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always check out the ReadMe for any Islandora/EMiC module you&#39;re installing (i.e. on the GitHub repository page for the module, scroll down past the file list to read the text, or look for the text file labeled README in the module folder you downloaded). There are often additional instructions beyond the usual way you install a module (e.g. dependencies to install, permissions to set).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to use the Drupal maintenance page module to hide my site from the public, but this prevented me from setting clean URLs on the site, which is required to make Islandora work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started seeing a problem where Fedora kept crashing/closing down on its own (which I could see by going to the yoursite.com:8080/fedora/admin page and not seeing the Fedora dashboard. This was solved by adding more memory to the server (i.e. purchasing a higher Linode plan, in my case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be mindful of what pieces of the platform need what version of Java. Running $FEDORA_HOME/tomcat/bin/startup.sh at one point, the output showed me that my JRE_HOME variable was pointing at the Java 6 OpenJDK, when it needed to be accessing the Sun JRE. I have a hazy memory that there&#39;s one piece of the Islandora set-up that requires one version of Java, and another that needs a different version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some random &quot;where is that again?&quot; notes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yoursite.com:8080/fedora/admin (your Fedora Repository admin dashboard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yoursite.com:8080/fedoragsearch (your Fedora gSearch admin; credentials are set in $FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora-users.xml)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yoursite.com:8080 (your Tomcat manager; set an admin user in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml and you can log in to view various processes running on your server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out $FEDORA_HOME/data/fedora-xacml-policies/repository-policies to make sure your Fedora access policies are secure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;/end brain dump&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Choosing the best format for your scholarship: digital dissertation edition</title>
   <link href="/2014/04/02/digitaldissformat"/>
   <updated>2014-04-02T07:30:44-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/04/02/digitaldissformat</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m participating in a panel on “What Does a 21st Century Dissertation Look Like?” in the University of Maryland English Department; we’ll explore various ways of conceiving a humanities dissertation other than the traditional monograph format. I’ve captured some notes from my talk here, as well as some related tweets and reading on the subject of non-monograph dissertations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My focus is on digital dissertations that aren’t auxiliary to or duplicated by a monograph, especially those where design and building are the main scholarly methodologies. Note that there are other examples out there of non-digital yet non-monograph humanities dissertations, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://spinweaveandcut.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Nick Sousanis’ comic-form dissertation&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of dissertations that combine a monograph with a digital component (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://drum.lib.umd.edu//handle/1903/9160&quot; &gt;Tanya Clement&#39;s digital editing and visualizations&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://hdl.handle.net/1903/13969&quot; &gt;Lisa Rhody’s topic modeling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A digital dissertation like mine &lt;strong&gt;is one of many equally valid options for dissertations&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;it’s a useful thought exercise for any dissertator to argue for the rightness of their chosen dissertational platform&lt;/strong&gt;, regardless of which format they choose. I&#39;m going to talk about the format that was right for my scholarly project, but my specific format is right for a specific intellectual query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve met surprisingly little resistance to choosing a unique format, more curiosity and willingness to understand. Most people are happy to support a project where you’ve obviously thought hard about how best to make your dissertation a contribution to scholarship. I think a lot of the misunderstanding around &quot;whether&quot; digital work can be scholarly stems from the different types of digital work out there (Also, from Wordles. Wordles!): sometimes you build a digital tool that requires further (often written) analysis to produce the intended knowledge, and sometimes, as when the intended knowledge deals with the use and effects of digital interfaces, the digital object itself can embody the argument. One study requires a written narrative; the other embeds its narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why my format?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary field of interest is textual studies, a sub-field within literary studies that concerns itself with the scholarly acts of editing and edition-making,  as well as preserving literary texts; more specifically, I’m interested in digital editing, which migrates these traditional scholarly practices to the online world, opening up possibilities for new ways of reading and studying literary texts. Much of the recent activity in textual studies as a discipline has followed this path, as an examination of the program for the annual Society for Textual Scholarship conference would confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most productive and efficacious (in terms of scholarly impact) way to push the current research, reading, and teaching capabilities of the digital edition further is to actually demonstrate them in practice, through the hands-on work of designing, building, and testing a digital platform for new editing practices. In many respects, my project is not much different from the previously accepted practice of producing a scholarly edition, complete with commentary and editorial apparatus, as a dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/06/25/iufeatures&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; participatory digital edition pursues a speculative experiment: what if we build an edition and &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; shows up and adds their annotations (interpretations, questions, contextualizations) to the text? Combining an unusually complex text (James Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;) with an approach imagining thousands of site users and annotations allows for the exploration of questions from overlapping fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Textual studies:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we create digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and the lay person in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information science:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (e.g. upvoting, tagging) to create reading and research experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of contextual annotation quantity but also quality, customizing the displayed annotations to the interests and experience of each reader?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literary studies:&lt;/strong&gt; What happens to complex texts—especially those Modernist novels purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic—under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot; &gt;read more about Infinite Ulysses here&lt;/a&gt;, starting with &lt;a title=&quot;My Digital Humanities Dissertation: Building Code, Design, and Games for Textual Knowledge and Participation&quot; href=&quot;/2013/04/09/dhdissintro&quot; &gt;this post about my overall dissertational agenda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/25/iufeatures&quot; &gt;this post outlining what Infinite Ulysses will actually look like and do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-18dd-0124-5648-838d2267d7be&quot;&gt;My dissertation’s format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deliverables I&#39;m preparing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; participatory digital edition (Drupal 7 site: theme design, module coding, interface behavior and incorporated user feedback)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public code repository and documentation on using my code to build a similar digital edition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal usability study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular blogging on the technical and theorizing processes (on this site!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scholarly digital article built from the blog posts and the usability study (the article will exist as an interactive website that also serves as a gathering point for links to the other pieces of the dissertation; &lt;a title=&quot;Designing a digital scholarly article&quot; href=&quot;/2014/03/31/html5scholarlyarticle&quot;&gt;see this post&lt;/a&gt; for more on the argument-through-visual-design format of the planned article)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article will include a scholarly introduction and conclusion to the entire body of dissertation research, a log of critical questions and challenges that arose during the design and coding processes, quantitative and qualitative analysis of user testing of the digital edition, and a theoretical discussion situating my work as developing a long tradition of editing and literary theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to do something similar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-18df-bf56-16f9-3a1513cde668&quot;&gt;I’ve written posts on &lt;a title=&quot;Five Tips for Getting Started on a Digital Humanities Dissertation&quot; href=&quot;/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation&quot;&gt;getting started on a digital dissertation&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. what should you do before submitting your prospectus?) and &lt;a title=&quot;Digital dissertation deliverables (and how to complete them!)&quot; href=&quot;/2013/08/14/timeandscope&quot; &gt;keeping up with your digital dissertation work&lt;/a&gt;. Once you&#39;re convinced the format you&#39;ve chosen is the best way to convey your dissertational argument, you&#39;ll want to draft short explanations (about a paragraph each) of what the format you wish to use is (defining any technical terms) and why you need to use it. Then, identify the parties from whom you need buy-in to make the dissertation work (both in terms of getting it officially accepted by the school, and to make sure your advisers are fully behind your decision) and share these drafts with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my university, I spoke with my advisor, dissertation committee, and department before submitting my prospectus; I also met with the person in charge of ingesting dissertations at the university library and the dean of the humanities school. Whenever possible, keep a written record of your statement of what your dissertation will consist of as well as these interested parties&#39; agreements to that vision. I&#39;m lucky in encountering thorough support from the people I spoke to, but I&#39;ve heard of other students having trouble late in the process when different parties expected different amounts of work to be produced for the degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-191b-d75c-6a01-2d8347cc73ec&quot;&gt;Benefits of a well-chosen dissertation format and/or a non-monograph format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.&lt;strong&gt; Justifying the format of your work is a useful thought exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; Choose how you best think through and convey your critical thinking so that you end up with the best possible support for your scholarly argument (e.g. I’ve always left seminar discussions with ideas for small digital tools that could answer a question I&#39;m wondering about, so exploring a digital dissertation was obvious for me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What format best supports what you’re arguing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What format best reaches the most people who can use and build on your work? (other students, scholars, interested public)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you used a different format, what would be possible? What would you lose and gain? What would you learn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Your dissertation isn&#39;t just a piece of scholarly work; it&#39;s also a representation to your future coworkers and collaborators of &lt;strong&gt;who you are and what you can do&lt;/strong&gt;. Use the dissertation to prepare for the job you want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider learning a new skill(s) as part of the process (but see the caveat below): a technical skill (PHP), delivery (develop an informal blogging voice that helps you think through scholarly questions more quickly), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the dissertation to develop polished examples of your existing skills to highlight when on the job market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about practicing job-skills that the degree doesn’t otherwise guarantee you (e.g. collaboration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-1925-e8c0-c132-8e543db4353e&quot;&gt;Challenges of non-monograph/digital dissertations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You could end up doubling your labor and time to degree, if any of the various parties in the path to a degree (committee, department, grad school...) will only let you pursue a digital component in addition to a monograph, or if you don&#39;t clearly set (in writing if possible) the size and scope of your deliverables early in the dissertation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If you&#39;re going to learn new skills as part of the dissertation, make sure your goals are reachable without much outside support. The best skills to work on are self-teachable and proximal to current abilities; for example, I&#39;m already a professional web developer with PHP experience, but I&#39;m using the dissertation to try some advanced things with the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Mentors might not be able to assist or review different forms as they can with a written chapter; it&#39;s more likely your advisors will be able to evaluate your end product, but not comment on the cleanliness, security, or critical thinking behind the lines of code (or comparable facets of other dissertational approaches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Does the job you want/places you’re interested in working value the methodologies/forms you’re using if you aren&#39;t working on the traditional monograph? Some won’t, and the economic reality is that you&#39;re probably okay with taking a job at one of these places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you want in your peer teachers? For example, if you&#39;d want your department to hire fellow teachers who are good and generous collaborators, how is your dissertation supporting that same quality in you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can&#39;t do the type of project you really want to do now, consider that you may never be able to: as an adjunct, junior faculty member, up for tenure review are not more friendly or safe times for innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Dissertating can be lonely: you&#39;ve reached the point of expertise where there are few people to talk to on your specific topic, and you&#39;re done with regular classes. Not sharing a common format with other students amplifies that loneliness and makes benefiting from the assistance that is available (such as writing groups) difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monographs have a circulation problem&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;By year +10 a monograph that has never circulated has less than a 1% chance of ever circulating. &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/5gZuWeGedT&quot;&gt;http://t.co/5gZuWeGedT&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - Yoni Appelbaum (@YAppelbaum) February 13, 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Nearly half of monographs in research libraries haven’t circulated, ten years after purchase: &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/kOcbsNQ2ir&quot;&gt;http://t.co/kOcbsNQ2ir&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - Yoni Appelbaum (@YAppelbaum) February 13, 2014&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The forms of scholarship&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;DH [digital humanities] arguments are encoded in code. I disagree with the notion that those arguments must be translated / re-encoded in text.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some examples of critical thought during digital work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those outside DH often underestimate the theoretical sophistication of many in computing, who deal every day, for example, with gaps between complex datamining algorithms and the practical sources of those data, or with the production of multiple, sometimes contradictory, visualizations from the same dataset. They know better than many of their humanist critics that their science is provisional and contingent, and that the results of research require interpretive acts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once I was presenting&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eafsd.org&quot;&gt; The Early American Foreign Service Database&lt;/a&gt; and got the question “So where is the theory in all of this?” Before I could answer with my standard, diplomatic but hopefully thought-provoking, response a longtime digital humanist called out “The database is the theory! This is real theoretical work!” I could have hugged her.[&lt;a href=&quot;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/who-you-calling-untheoretical-by-jean-bauer/#who-you-calling-untheoretical-by-jean-bauer-n-9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;] When we create these systems we bring our theoretical understandings to bear on our digital projects including (but not limited to) decisions about: controlled vocabulary (or the lack thereof), search algorithms, interface design, color palettes, and data structure. Is every digital humanities project a perfect gem of theoretically rigorous investigation? Of course not. Is every monograph? Don’t make me laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Designing a digital scholarly article</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be speaking on a panel on &quot;21st-Century Forms for the Dissertation&quot; on Wednesday, and will have more general thoughts to share on using forms other than the monograph to convey your scholarly argument then. Today, though, I&#39;ll describe my plans for one of the pieces of my unusually formatted dissertation: &lt;strong&gt;an &quot;interactive&quot; scholarly article&lt;/strong&gt; that will serve as public entrance into my dissertational research (I&#39;ll get to what the heck the much-abused word &quot;interactive&quot; means here in a minute!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dissertation&#39;s focus is a website—the &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; participatory digital edition of James Joyce&#39;s novel &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;—and the critical design, coding, contextual annotation, and user-testing work that will make up that piece of scholarly digital editing (Note that I&#39;ve downsized the project from the previous three different coding projects&lt;/a&gt; to focus on just this Ulysses piece. The dissertation actually had five different coding projects when I was writing my prospectus for it originally... but then I decided I wanted to graduate! I may still pursue the Rochfort-Smith critical visual design project, but that&#39;ll depend on the kind of usability work I need to do on the Ulysses site after initial testing.). This &quot;interactive&quot; article is already building itself through my regular blogging on this site, but it will be more polished than some of this blogging, and also offer some writing that doesn&#39;t make it onto the blog for one reason or other, like a research bibliography and full analysis of my user-testing results. The article will also link out to the other pieces of my dissertational work: the &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; participatory digital edition, code repositories, this blog, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the dissertation, the idea was to work with a publishing platform that welcomes new media submissions so that I could publish my code/design work as well as my writing—but I&#39;ve since decided that a developing form of web design that interests me would also be the perfect format for this article. I&#39;ve called it &quot;an interactive scholarly article&quot; above, I call it an &quot;HTML5 manifesto&quot; in my head, and the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; calls their version of it &quot;interactive storytelling&quot;, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some specific phrase that would better capture the picture that&#39;s been developing in my head. What I&#39;m hoping to produce is a HTML5 site that uses the fact that it isn&#39;t a printed page of paper to convey my argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does that look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s look at some examples of this admittedly broad form to quickly give you the best sense of what I&#39;m thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The New York Time&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/12/30/year-in-interactive-storytelling&quot;&gt;gallery of &quot;interactive storytelling&quot; pieces&lt;/a&gt; from last year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two random articles from elsewhere on the web I&#39;ve had bookmarked as examples: an &lt;a href=&quot;http://eephusleague.com/magazine&quot;&gt;article on baseball history&lt;/a&gt; and one on &lt;a href=&quot;http://editsquarterly.com&quot;&gt;photography/film&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://octoverse.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&#39;s example&lt;/a&gt; is more like a scrolling slideshow, but I like the emphasis on graphics and charts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty sure I&#39;ve read some e-lit that functions very similarly, too...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These all function by scrolling down to reveal more content (rather than using the codex-holdover of multiple pages), and employ features such as typography, layout, and embedded video to unfold their narrative—an approach I&#39;ve personally enjoyed reading, and that gives me a better mental map of the argument I&#39;m following than a traditional paper does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is chunked into sections that may be related in more than the normal linear fashion, in order to cover the multiple but related preoccupations of my work. A virtue of this approach is that I can use space to make an argument more easily than in the confines of an ordinary print page. For example, to discuss the speculative experiment part of my work as it impacts different mechanical pieces of my site such as tagging and voting, I can branch the page into three areas representing different aspects of the approach in respect to each feature, with and links arrows connecting among these three strains of thought—or maybe a chart listing &quot;features&quot; down one side (tagging, voting, etc.) and how past scholarly attempts (e.g. how other DH projects have experienced crowd-tagging), my usability study (e.g. the reality of crowd-tagging I observe via my user study), and my thought experiment (what I think I might observe if the site actually encountered the speculative state of being annotated and tagged by &quot;everyone&quot;) each reflect on that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is a bit hard to picture... it&#39;s because this is an approach for those times when you really need to be drawing on a whiteboard at the same time as talking, or showing a slide, or otherwise supporting verbal argument with visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible Issues: Accessibility, Effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll need to do some research into the accessibility of this design approach, but I think that unlike similar-looking sites from years ago (e.g. sites using image slices, Flash, and other early-e-lit-like approaches), the use of clean HTML5 here actually lets the content be extremely screenreader-friendly (well structured, free from cruft). That also means that the core textual content should be easy to print off for purposes of pre-defense comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll also need to be certain I don&#39;t get distracted by the fun of designing/coding this article at the expense of time that could be better spent on other aspects of the dissertation. I think this approach is definitely worth the effort: it&#39;s likely to welcome more people to reading my dissertation, and make the dissertation more accessible in multiple senses of the word (available on the web, form/layout supports understanding of arguments, link to further reading on non-literary terms of art such as the HCI terminology I&#39;ll be using). Being a really fun thing to do as a web designer is just a happy bonus of the form!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Tutorial: Omeka+Imagemagick Happiness with MAMP Pro 3</title>
   <link href="/2014/03/28/imagemagickomekamamp"/>
   <updated>2014-03-28T04:55:20-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/03/28/imagemagickomekamamp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Official ImageMagick logo from Wikmedia Commons (GPL 2).&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Imagemagick-logo-290x300.png&quot; width=&quot;232&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official ImageMagick logo from Wikmedia Commons (GPL 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make websites, you&#39;ve probably worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imagemagick.org&quot;&gt;Imagemagick&lt;/a&gt; and know it&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/forums/search.php?q=imagemagick&quot; &gt;pain in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topicsearchin/omeka-dev/imagemagick|sort:date|spell:true&quot; &gt;the butt&lt;/a&gt; to get working (especially for Mac local development)—and if you want to use an awesome CMS like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omeka.org&quot; &gt;Omeka&lt;/a&gt; (super for digital archives, collections, museums) to display still images, you&#39;ll need Imagemagick. Used to be you&#39;d need to lose some time finagling (possibly setting up Homebrew) to get ImageMagick to work, but if you&#39;re already using MAMP, it might be worth your while to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog-en.mamp.info&quot;&gt;upgrade to MAMP Pro 3&lt;/a&gt; and make things easier on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Instructions (once you&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog-en.mamp.info&quot;&gt;installed MAMP Pro 3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These instructions assume knowledge of installing an Omeka site locally using MAMP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the MAMP config window, go to the &quot;PHP&quot; tab and note which version of PHP you&#39;re using.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Where to locate the version of PHP MAMP is using&quot; src=&quot;/assets/whichphp.png&quot; width=&quot;748&quot; height=&quot;172&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look under the PHP tab in the MAMP Pro 3 settings window to locate the version of PHP MAMP is using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Finder, go to and open in a text editor this file: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.10/conf/php.ini&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Note that you&#39;re looking in the MAMP (not MAMP Pro) folder, and that you should replace &quot;&lt;em&gt;php5.5.10&lt;/em&gt;&quot; in the file path above with the folder that matches whatever version of PHP you identified you&#39;re using in Step #1 (i.e. go into whatever folder has the same PHP version you&#39;re using—I&#39;m just using PHP 5.5.10 in this example).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the line that says &lt;strong&gt;;extension=imagick.so&lt;/strong&gt; (line 542 in my MAMP Pro 3.0.2) and remove the semi-colon from the front of the line (so the line now just says &lt;strong&gt;extension=imagick.so&lt;/strong&gt;). This uncomments the imagemagick module so that MAMP makes it available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the file and close it. You may need to restart your MAMP servers or just restart MAMP for this change to take effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the &quot;settings&quot; tab on the admin dashboard for your local Omeka site (yoursitename/admin/settings/edit-settings), scroll to the bottom, and enter &lt;strong&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/strong&gt; in the &quot;ImageMagick Directory Path&quot; field. Click the &quot;Save Changes&quot; button on the upper-right.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Where to type the ImageMagick path in the Omeka dashboard settings&quot; src=&quot;/assets/imagemagickpath.png&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height=&quot;90&quot;&gt; Type the ImageMagick path at the bottom of the page in the Omeka dashboard settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagemagick should now work—you should be able to add &quot;still image&quot; types of files to your local Omeka site, and Omeka will create thumbnails of the images and display the thumbnails and original size images correctly. If you&#39;ve got a bunch of images you want to add as separate items, I recommend using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/dropbox&quot;&gt;Dropbox plugin&lt;/a&gt; (doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the Dropbox backup site), which lets you batch upload a folder full of images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Alternative: Vagrant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that another way to make Imagemagick finagling simpler is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vagrantup.com&quot;&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt; (if you&#39;ve ever worked with a virtual machine, for example to run Windows on a Mac, it&#39;s like developing in a virtual machine and being able to easily boot up a machine with a new copy of the CMS of your choice configured how you want, easily move that dev site to a public site, and not have any of this mess with the settings on your host computer/laptop the way you might need to do when using MAMP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the awesome digital humanities devs at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarslab.org&quot;&gt;Scholars&#39; Lab &lt;/a&gt;share Vagrant+Chef code and documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omeka.org&quot; &gt;Omeka&lt;/a&gt; sites &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scholarslab/cookbooks&quot; &gt;at this GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; (haven&#39;t actually used it myself yet, but planning to very soon). Working with Vagrant takes some learning, though, so if you don&#39;t have the time/desire to add a useful webdev skill to your toolkit just now, the MAMP Pro 3 route might be better for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/michaelck/puppet-lamp-stack-for-omeka&quot; &gt;this Vagrant+Puppet LAMP/Omeka set-up&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub by MichaelCK. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/omeka-dev/0vkYN2pWWgM&quot; &gt;HT the Omeka Dev listserv!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using MAMP Pro 3 to make local Omeka dev easier after &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/omeka-dev/DVER4WHGUjc/UDAyWg4CcCwJ&quot; &gt;user niek noted its awesomeness&lt;/a&gt; on the Omeka Dev listserv (hat tip!).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Digital Professionalism for Graduate Students: How to Use Twitter, Blogging, and the Rest of the Web as an Academic</title>
   <link href="/2014/02/10/digital-professionalism"/>
   <updated>2014-02-10T08:00:12-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/02/10/digital-professionalism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some reasons graduate students (and any scholars) should maintain an online presence, with an emphasis on using Twitter and blogging to develop intellectually and professionally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogging is magic&lt;/strong&gt; (I&#39;m blogging right now!). Blogging can help you develop content for your dissertation, article, or future conference paper, without the same constraints of sitting down to produce a formal essay. Blogging helps develop your unique voice and trains you to write for various audiences—not just the colleagues you&#39;re used to, but for those outside your field or outside academia as well (you should be able to explain your intellectual passions to a non-academic audience, anyway). Blogging publicly identifies you as actively engaged with the topics you research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An online presence demonstrates &lt;strong&gt;competency at presenting yourself&lt;/strong&gt;: professionalism in online interactions, and the social and intellectual acumen to develop a network of collaboration and discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employers will look you up online&lt;/strong&gt;. An online presence (CV site, LinkedIn account, Twitter) is your chance to shape what they see. What aspects of your work do you want to make certain prospective collaborators and colleagues see?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter lets you keep up on the latest&lt;/strong&gt; academic arguments, productions, events, and opportunities. Besides helping you track a field&#39;s preoccupations on a schedule more frequent than your field&#39;s key periodicals, tweeting can also serve as note-taking during scholarly events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweeting and blogging about your work &lt;strong&gt;can result in invitations&lt;/strong&gt; to speak or serve on panels, take part in projects, and otherwise collaborate with like-minded thinkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most importantly&lt;/strong&gt;: be part of the &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt; academic community, too:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Participation in digital community=helps you ID potential collaborators: interesting/strong thinkers &amp;amp; who operates generously/in good faith&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amanda Visconti (@Literature_Geek) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/432921938206273539&quot;&gt;February 10, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Developing an online identity = being part of an academic community. As w/offline, listen/collaborate/amplify others for mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amanda Visconti (@Literature_Geek) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/432921938172723200&quot;&gt;February 10, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are notes from my part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english.umd.edu/events/5513&quot; &gt;a February 10, 2014 panel&lt;/a&gt; in the University of Maryland English Department on using the digital as an academic professional. I presented with Professors &lt;a href=&quot;http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Matt Kirschenbaum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://madwomanwithalaptop.com&quot;&gt;Marilee Lindemann&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joshuaweiner.com&quot;&gt;Joshua Weiner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Marilee &lt;a href=&quot;http://madwomanwithalaptop.com/2014/02/11/advice-for-virtual-and-actual-life-dont-be-a-butthead&quot;&gt;posted her remarks from the panel&lt;/a&gt; on her blog (&lt;a href=&quot;http://madwomanwithalaptop.com/2014/02/11/advice-for-virtual-and-actual-life-dont-be-a-butthead&quot;&gt;Madwoman with a Laptop&lt;/a&gt;), and it&#39;s a great read: how university social media policies factor into your online presentation and future job search, balancing blogging (often a labor of love with less tangible benefits than traditional scholarly work) with efforts that are more commonly accepted toward tenure and promotion, and how to generally &quot;not be a butthead&quot; in your social media use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;cv&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Get Your CV/Portfolio Online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandavisconti&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; (connect with colleagues, join groups like the Versatile Ph.D. and the official groups for academic organizations where you&#39;re a member)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reclaimhosting.com&quot;&gt;Reclaim Hosting&lt;/a&gt; (for your academic blog, online portfolio, or class website; $12/first year, $20-30/year thereafter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free online website/portfolio services exist, but I don&#39;t know much about them. I&#39;d caution against using them unless you can&#39;t find an alternative that works for you: you either get ads on your site (not super professional) or are stuck with a site that looks like a million others, as with Wordpress.com&#39;s free blog hosting. (On the other hand, non-web-devs probably don&#39;t notice or care that your Wordpress.com site looks like many others, and having a well-presented CV site is better than not having one.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When structuring your CV/online portfolio, think about the areas of your professional life you want to emphasize; background that best supports your hiring in the type of job you desire or collaboration in activities of interest to you should be foremost. Create categories if they don&#39;t exist but would highlight your abilities. Don&#39;t let good skills/experiences get buried because they aren&#39;t highlighted by traditional CV categories (e.g. on my CV I have sections for professional grants I&#39;ve applied for/the amounts I&#39;ve been awarded for them, conferences and conference panels I&#39;ve organized, and guest blog posts I&#39;ve been asked to write).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CV or online portfolio? A digital CV is just like a print one, but it&#39;s readable online and/or downloadable as a PDF. An online portfolio is less of a list and more of a showcase of projects, papers, awards, and other achievements that define you as a scholar, allowing for fewer examples but more narrative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to Do Twitter as an Academic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter basics: &lt;strong&gt;RT&lt;/strong&gt; means &quot;retweet&quot; (share others&#39; tweets with your followers while attributing the original tweeter); &lt;strong&gt;MT&lt;/strong&gt; means &quot;modified tweet&quot; (use when RT&#39;ing but shortening or otherwise altering the original tweet); &lt;strong&gt;ICYMI&lt;/strong&gt; (in case you missed it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTs are easy to do (most apps have both an RT and a &quot;quote&quot;/MT button) and useful; &lt;em&gt;even better&lt;/em&gt; is to read the link you&#39;re RT&#39;ing, and prepend your RT with your thoughts (e.g. why you suggest reading it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a tweet &lt;strong&gt;@someone&lt;/strong&gt; means that only that person and people who follow both you and that person will see the tweet in their timelines (although anyone can see the tweet by visiting either of your timelines). Put a period in front of the @username to let all your followers read it. When quoting someone, always attribute; the &lt;strong&gt;.@someone&lt;/strong&gt; trick is the concise, accepted way of doing this if the person has a Twitter handle:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremydouglass&quot;&gt;@jeremydouglass&lt;/a&gt; Can&amp;#39;t simply continue to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/elit?src=hash&quot;&gt;#elit&lt;/a&gt; works we care about now, need to also discover/recover the non-canon&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amanda Visconti (@Literature_Geek) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/428988369847066624&quot;&gt;January 30, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use hashtags if you want people who are searching for that hashtag to find your tweet. Hashtags for conferences, events, and courses are a great way to follow along. Most people use non-event hashtags sparingly #because #they&#39;re #not #fun #to #read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://storify.com&quot;&gt;Storify&lt;/a&gt; to curate tweets and other social media, as with show an online conversation that happened in response to an event (here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://storify.com/literature_geek/any-examples-of-lit-dept-phd-dissertations-that-do&quot;&gt;an example Storify&lt;/a&gt; I made of a Twitter conversation about digital dissertations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various Twitter apps (e.g. Tweetdeck) let you schedule tweets ahead of time. This is great if you want to tweet links to your work while speaking on a panel, or to sync a tweet linking to a new blog post of yours with the publication of that post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping up with Twitter can take time; I&#39;ve moved my Twitter usage off my computer (so I&#39;m not distracted while working) and check it while commuting on the train.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Who/What to Follow on Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some following ideas for starting out on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/lists/umd-english-tweeps&quot;&gt;UMD English Twitter List &lt;/a&gt;(faculty, graduate students, alumni; tweet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/Literature_Geek&quot; &gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt; to be added)... or for non-UMD folks, check if anyone in your department has started a similar list (if not, starting it yourself is a good excuse to tweet with others on your campus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live-tweeted events (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mla14&amp;src=typd&quot; &gt;the MLA conference&lt;/a&gt;; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23elit&amp;src=typd&quot; &gt;the #elit hashtag&lt;/a&gt; for an event on electronic literature we live-tweeted at MITH a week and a half ago). Search &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mla14&amp;src=typd&quot; &gt;#ml14&lt;/a&gt; and #s + the session number you&#39;re interested in (e.g. #mla14 #s421; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mla.org/pdf/2014conventionguide3web.pdf&quot; &gt;the online MLA program&lt;/a&gt; for these).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W. W. Norton&#39;s (of giant Norton Anthology fame) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wwnorton/thinkers/members&quot;&gt;list of public intellectuals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists created by fellow graduate students, academics in your field, or of people attending a given academic conference (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattlaschneider/lists/sts-people&quot; &gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; of attendees at the Society for Textual Scholarship conference). Many users share public lists on their profile pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellectual leaders in your subfield(s): look up the authors of your favorite books, both academic and fiction. Hear about their latest thinking, give thoughtful responses to work they tweet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Privacy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wolfram Alpha&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolframalpha.com/facebook&quot;&gt;extensive analysis of your Facebook data&lt;/a&gt; is a good reminder of the information that can be put together from what you post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your students read your tweets. So do prospective employers. Assume everyone—your parents, your administrators, the professor who wrote that book you hate/love so much you&#39;re tweeting about it—is reading your tweets. People don&#39;t need to be following you to read your tweets (unless your account if locked; see below). Even if it isn&#39;t true that everyone&#39;s reading your tweets, thinking like this will help you write things you won&#39;t regret in the future. And the good side of everyone being on Twitter is that it&#39;s easier to get into a conversation with someone whose academic work you admire, or scholars thinking about the same questions from different campuses and countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning on making your social media accounts (or particular posts/tweets) private when job-seeking as an excuse to use them loosely now is a bad idea (unless your use of them is purely social and less than flattering... but in that case you might consider making them private all the time). Once you post a thing, various sites (e.g. Topsy) archive it and don&#39;t delete it even if you delete the original post/tweet; if someone retweets your tweet, that RT also lives on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t lock your Twitter account unless you&#39;re not using it for professional reasons. Part of being on Twitter is having non-followers read your tweets (and by extension, hear about your work) and start following you/become part of your academic conversation.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>A Speculative Experiment, Useful Here and Now?: Tagging the Digital Edition</title>
   <link href="/2013/12/16/speculative-experiment-useful-here-and-now"/>
   <updated>2013-12-16T07:20:50-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/12/16/speculative-experiment-useful-here-and-now</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do you conduct a speculative experiment around a digital humanities tool, while also creating something that&#39;s useful to readers and scholars right now? I&#39;ve been using a site policy on tagging to test the differences between my speculative design and the probable reality of my site&#39;s use.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro&quot; &gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; participatory digital edition will let readers and scholars add contextual annotations to James Joyce&#39;s Ulysses. Those annotations can be tagged with a word or phrase that will help other readers find their particular signal in the potential noise of a (hypothetically) heavily annotated text; possibilities arising from tagging annotations include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filtering the annotations to only show those on particular areas of interest (e.g. annotations that translate foreign words, or annotations aimed at first-time readers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filtering &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; annotations the reader doesn&#39;t want to see (e.g. spoilers about something that only becomes clear later in the book)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easily creating a curated &quot;edition&quot; of Ulysses aimed at a specific topic (e.g. an edition meant for use by a class focusing on the place of books, letters, newspapers, and other written material in the Modernist novel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulysses&#39; complexity and hypertextuality make it a great candidate for extension through intense annotation, and I&#39;ve &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro&quot; &gt;written previously&lt;/a&gt; about scholarly concerns over what heavy contextual annotation and interpretation would do to the text: two circumstances that make Ulysses perfect for a speculative experiment (An approach that can learn about an object such as a digital edition by imagining and designing for a hypothetical and/or future circumstance) in designing a digital edition with thousands of users actively creating content (annotations, questions/answers) on the site, and generally using the features of the site to their limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So: tagged annotations, and a site designed to customize a large amount of noise so that each reader receives the signal he or she requires.&lt;/strong&gt; How can I make this tagging actually work—both in my speculative experiment hypothetical of thousands of active site users, and in the more realistic possibility of far less activity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building for Two Extremes of Site Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see two possible routes for tag creation: restricting users to a limited set of tags I provide myself (perhaps supplemented with user-created tags by specific request), or allowing users to create and apply their own tags that become part of the public pool of available tags (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy&quot; &gt;a folksonomy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust the users to find how tags serve them best: &lt;/strong&gt;I start from the premise that allowing users more control over their reading experience provides them with a more customized reading experience, a major goal of the site. I&#39;d prefer to model what I see as appropriate use of tags, and then assume users will employ the feature in a way that benefits their reading and, by extension, that of other users (even if not in the way I expected). From my experiences dealing with spam and observing internet trolling, though, I&#39;ll have a plan in place for moderation of tags before they join the public pool, if early use of the site suggests a need for it (and I assume I&#39;ll need some sort of anti-spam tactics, although requiring user accounts and IP banning will be of some help in preventing spammers and allowing real users more freedom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So Much Annotation Tagging!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my &lt;strong&gt;speculative experiment&lt;/strong&gt; hat on, allowing users to build an unbridled folksonomy of thousands of tags sounds like problems: too many tags for moderation by one dissertating graduate student, redundant tags with slightly different spellings or phrasings, and an overwhelming list of possible tags for the user to select from are all possible problems. For a site dealing with extreme amounts of user-generated content, good approaches to moderation draw on the user community (e.g. as in asking users to click a &quot;flag as inappropriate/spam&quot; button when spam is encountered).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation&quot;&gt;StackExchange&#39;s approach to moderation&lt;/a&gt; (I&#39;m also thinking about incorporating StackExchange&#39;s feed of unanswered questions into the site—a quick way to see parts of the text you might help another person with, and a way to generate &quot;reputation&quot; points toward a user undergoing less moderation and more automatically public content), which requires site users to build up &quot;reputation&quot; points through successively more broader site privileges. These privileges range from users who have contributed very little to the site being limited to actions such as flagging posts, to those who have performed enough &quot;reputable&quot; actions on the site being allowed moderator-like abilities such as casting deletion votes on negatively voted answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I don&#39;t want users to have any waiting time before jumping into using the site, I&#39;d need to modify StackExchange&#39;s approach so that new users have a full range of user abilities from the very start—but whether annotations and answers they create are visible to the public could be dependent on their site activity (time spent on the site, indicating reading) and/or their contributions (one decent annotation = probably not a spammer). I&#39;d also allow users to create opt-in groups of users who can see their annotations regardless of whether they&#39;re visible to the general public, allowing users such as literature classes or book clubs to work together with no delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Reasonable Amount of Annotation Tagging?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;reality&lt;/strong&gt;, the site won&#39;t generate that extreme level of content described by my speculative experiment. Anecdotal evidence from other &lt;a href=&quot;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org&quot;&gt;Speaking in Code&lt;/a&gt; attendees suggests that site users creating too many tags won&#39;t be an issue; the more likely reality (as with any DH project) is that your project doesn&#39;t see enough visitors turn into site users, or enough site users actively adding content (such as new tags) to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less site use than my speculative extreme is good, because I can design a site that draws on StackExchange&#39;s and Reddit&#39;s communal moderation, while putting into place a policy that relies on content generation being low enough that I can moderate it if needed (with the help of a &quot;flag for moderation&quot; option for users). The site is built around the idea of communal discussion of Ulysses, and I&#39;d much rather need to moderate public content after it&#39;s been posted, then place any delay on a user sharing his thoughts with the community. The StackExchange approach, while great for professionals who have a reason to return to the site and build up reputation, doesn&#39;t work quite as well for a DH project where any barrier to entry might turn away potential readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be gathering statistics (e.g. &quot;Community Transcription — Thirty-One Months&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?p=1442&quot; &gt;http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?p=1442&lt;/a&gt;) and noting design decisions on other crowdsourcing projects over the coming month, with an emphasis on crowdsourcing that requires active user decision-making or interpretation. Crowdsourcing that specifically asks for little active attention on the part of the user is a great place to learn about intuitive design, though. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/POrg&quot; &gt;Peter Organisciak&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s recent blog post &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://crowdresearch.org/blog/?p=8320&quot; &gt;CrowdCamp Report: Waitsourcing, approaches to low-effort crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;&quot; prototypes several crowdsourcing instruments that demonstrate useful ways of lowering effort for user participation, suggesting some novel ways of asking users to help with annotation tags (e.g. I could separate tagging into a feed as with the unanswered questions, or place a small widget in the footer of the site that pulls up an untagged annotation and asks for a tag... unclear whether those would be useful or used, but food for thought).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; project, I expect to address each site feature (e.g. annotation tagging) across three contexts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precedents from other DH projects (e.g. how tagging moderation was addressed, the amount of tagging users actually supplied)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the statistical realities of my site, observed via user studies (how often was moderation required? how many tags did users actually apply to annotations?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what designing the site with a speculative experiment in mind teaches me about the limits of digital editions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Blended Approach to Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current thinking is to take a blended approach to tags: seed the Infinite Ulysses site with contextual annotations before opening it for public viewing, and also seed those annotations with tags (Tags will link to page with a paragraph providing more information about the tag (for user-provided tags, these might need to be created by me?).) from a small set of broadly useful ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each foreign language that appears in the text (church Latin, French...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literary references (e.g. Milton, Shakespeare&#39;s specific plays)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clues (e.g. to the identity of Bloom&#39;s correspondent and Macintosh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spoilers (annotations drawing on information you&#39;d only know if you&#39;d already read the book)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vocabulary (help with difficult words, the history and contemporary uses of particular phrases or slang)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music (making it easy to pull up references to song, lyrics, poetry in the text)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple and advanced plot explanations (can be toggled off for those not interested in this help)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading media (references to books, newsprint, letters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colonialism and usurpation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of tagging that indicates the granularity of an annotation, so that annotations appropriate for scholars versed in interpretations of the book reach them, and annotations helpful to a first-time-reader understanding of the book reach those users (suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Yellworque&quot; &gt;Ronan Crowley&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users will be free to add their own tags, but I&#39;ll keep a close eye on site usee during user testing and decide whether those user-created tags will be automatically public, visible only to the user who created them until I moderate them, or start as private but automatically appear publicly once the user has proven understanding of site use with some small level of activity on the site (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation&quot;&gt;the StackExchange approach&lt;/a&gt;). When I begin user-testing, I&#39;ll have a chance to ask users what their preference is and see how tagging might actually play out; I&#39;m excited for my users to show me which option is best for them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Infinite Ulysses: Usability Personas and Site Content Ideas</title>
   <link href="/2013/12/12/iuusabilitypersonasandsitecontent"/>
   <updated>2013-12-12T07:30:40-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/12/12/iuusabilitypersonasandsitecontent</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m starting to flesh out the &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; site&#39;s content: pages explaining my methodology, how to use the site, etc. Eventually, I&#39;ll be thinking about how I want people to progress through the site (by creating and walking through the site in several example user personas and how they&#39;ll probably actually use the site (arrive and want to jump right in to reading the text and using the features).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the latter (most likely) case, I&#39;ll probably offer a short (60 seconds or less) video tutorial on setting up an account and using all the features of the site, as well as an option that walks you through one way of using the site (probably something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/building&quot; &gt;how NYPL Labs introduces users to their Building Inspector site&lt;/a&gt;). I&#39;ll need to figure out how to balance people who want to jump right into site use via intuitive design of the various features, and encouraging site visitors to take five minutes and learn the site&#39;s full capabilities before using it. Those visitors who actually end up reading some or all of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; on the site will be spending a lot of time on it, so it&#39;s worth their while to know all the features available to them—but it will be my job to convince them of that (and make the features worthy of their use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability Testing and Site Visitor Personas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not at the point of testing the site via personas yet, but I&#39;ve started to record feedback from various people I&#39;ve talked with about my projects with an eye toward the personas&#39; eventual creation. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html&quot; &gt;usability persona&lt;/a&gt; is a representation of a potential user group for your website, based on real feedback and condensed into a single representative fictional character against which you can test the site experience. I&#39;ve given my initial personas silly names to help me quickly step through these four approaches to site use whenever I&#39;m considering a new feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-62083738-cad2-c155-8675-fd852dff0faa&quot;&gt;
&lt;li &gt;Riley Read-Everything (a user who wants to go through all the background info on the site before committing to reading, who needs a clear architecture for reading through the various non-&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; pages on the site)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;Jessie Jump-Right-In (a first-time reader of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses &lt;/em&gt;who jumps right into reading and annotating and asking questions, requiring intuitively designed site functionality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;Taylor the Teacher (a user orchestrating group work on &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, possibly with private annotations or other teaching/book club requirements)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;Sam the Scholar (a user with some &lt;em&gt;Ulysses &lt;/em&gt;experience who wants to help out by adding contextual annotations and answering questions, perhaps by adding a bulk list of their existing annotations; and/or wants to understand and engage in scholarly uses of the site such as curating a themed/argument-making set of annotations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The persona walkthroughs will be followed by real site use and usability testing, first with a small group of friends and colleagues (which will help me create an updated set of usability personas), then with a limited beta testing group, and finally with the site open to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Site Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A developing list of content for informational pages I&#39;ll probably want to publish on the Infinite Ulysses site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/#inclusivity&quot; &gt;the Speaking in Code inclusivity statement&lt;/a&gt;, a statement of welcome encouraging participation by everyone, with a contact form for suggestions on how the site can better its users. This page will also address the positive rights of the site users, such as the site being a safe space to ask questions (however simple) and to provide answers from any viewpoint, and a clear path for reporting any issues within the site user community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User profile pages (for finding active readers on the site who have similar interests or backgrounds, for recording demographics on the site user base, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An explanation of copyrights and other licensing active on the site (what rights do users maintain over content shared with the site? what licenses have I applied to my written content, code, and design?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background material on Joyce and the writing of Ulysses (e.g. Ulysses&#39; legal history, versions of the work from drafts onward)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development blog (with a timeline, of site work new features, bugs fixed, questions for existing users)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A support forum (intended for questions about site usage and bug reporting; postings that are questions about the text may be lifted to the textual annotations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An explanation of the core set of tags I&#39;m providing when the site opens for public use (what they mean, who they may be useful to, why I included them, how to add your own)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future plans for the site, with a poll on possible future features of the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unanswered queue: questions about the text that haven&#39;t received an answer are pulled onto this page so that it&#39;s easier for me and other site users to help one another out in their interpretations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A page describing the accessibility/universal design work done on the site, future plans for greater accessibility, and a form for suggesting other tactics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use the mobile version of the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use the site in the classroom to teach &lt;em&gt;Ulysses &lt;/em&gt;(how to let students privately annotate the text and have that work only visible to their teacher; how to let students curate their own themed digital edition version of the text)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use the site in reading groups (e.g. book clubs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to add annotations to the site in bulk (i.e. if you have a list or file of Ulysses annotations for some reason and wish to add them to the text without typing them in one by one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An explanation of annotation moderation policy (e.g. I reserve the right to unpublish or delete content that is spam, defamatory, or otherwise not supportive of the goals of the project. Whenever the possibility of the content being added to the site in good faith is present, I will contact the author of the content upon unpublishing and either give them a few days to copy their content from the site before I delete it, or send them a copy of the content.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information on my digital humanities and Joyce studies backgrounds, as well as my interests and biases as they effect interpretation of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; and design of digital editions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Copyleft, IP Rights, and Digital Humanities Dissertations</title>
   <link href="/2013/12/09/dhiprights"/>
   <updated>2013-12-09T07:00:35-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/12/09/dhiprights</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Who holds the intellectual property (IP) rights to your digital dissertation? In my case, the answer is complicated, involving multiple licenses and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital humanities productions brings new licensing concerns to the humanities. Our pre-digital discussions around IP usually centered around book contracts and open-access journals; rights claims from any agency that funds you during the production of a scholarly work might affect where you can publish or what types of acknowledgement you must include, but I&#39;m assuming such agreements rarely control the reuse or extension of that work the way licensing for code, design, and digital content does. Digital humanities dissertations are an interesting case, given that they are usually &quot;authored&quot; by one person (although they may benefit from just as much collaborative support from librarians, faculty, and other academic mentors as any other scholarly endeavor), not completed while on the clock for a job, and may be supported funding from multiple sources, with a variety of IP stakes in your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; project, I&#39;m building off open-source code from a variety of sources: the community of Drupal developers, a tech non-profit, and a grant-funded initiative (&lt;a href=&quot;http://editingmodernism.ca&quot; &gt;Editing Modernism in Canada&lt;/a&gt;) that is also providing a fellowship supporting a year of my dissertational work. In drafting an IP agreement for this project, I needed to think both about the rights I want to assert for the code (Drupal modules), design (Drupal themes), and content (written annotations, tutorials, etc. appearing on my sites) I create, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my continued access to code created by others (e.g. after the end of the fellowship, would I have access to updated versions of code from my funder?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to think that good faith keeps DH informational exchanges smooth and that IP agreements—especially for projects like dissertations—will never need to act as real shields. On the other hand, digital projects have an unfortunate history of not being correctly attributed; digital archives are consulted but not cited, or a digital object is used but the (unused) print version is cited. Good working relationships with funders or departments aren&#39;t a shield against pressure for commercial gains from higher up in a university or organization, or different ideas about intellectual property when an organization shifts into new hands. Being clear on the IP status of the different pieces of your digital dissertation is good practice, even if it&#39;s only an exercise to help you think about licensing future, larger projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, I can think of twelve forms of information I&#39;m dealing with in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; project, with varied IP licensing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Information I&#39;m creating:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Posts about the project appearing on my personal research blog (&lt;a title=&quot;Home&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com&quot;&gt;LiteratureGeek.com;&lt;/a&gt; the site is marked &quot;CC BY-NC unless otherwise specified&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Content blogged or cross-posted to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://editingmodernism.ca/community&quot;&gt;EMiC blog&lt;/a&gt; (unclear)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Contextual annotations, questions, and answers affixed to the text of Ulysses, created by me (almost definitely some flavor of Creative Commons license)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Infinite Ulysses site content (e.g. tutorials, about page text, etc.; possibly rights reserved, possibly CC0 if I want to go the whole way with the idea that anyone should be able to completely replicate my work)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Marketing/outreach materials (e.g. tweets, stickers, videos; some flavor of Creative Commons license )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information created by others:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/portfolio/ulysses-shakespeare-co-1922-1st-edn&quot;&gt;CC-licensed MVP Ulysses text&lt;/a&gt; (digitized by Matthew Kochis and Patrick Belk of the University of Tulsa; CC BY-NC-SA 3.0; production funded by one or more grants)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. The open-source &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; CMS (The trademark &quot;Drupal&quot; belongs to Dries Buytaert, but the Drupal Association has the ability to use the trademark freely as long as it meets certain requirements. The Drupal files and all contributed files hosted on Drupal.org, such as modules and themes, are licensed under the GNU General Public License. Drupal offers an &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org/licensing/faq&quot; &gt;extensive licensing FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Various used-as-is Drupal modules, and Drupal modules created by other developers and then modified/extended by me (GPL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Code gathered from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Islandora&quot; &gt;Islandora repos&lt;/a&gt; (GPL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Code gathered from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DGI-EMiC&quot; &gt;DGI-EMiC repos&lt;/a&gt; (GPL or unclear)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. Contextual annotations, questions, answers, profile information, and any other content an Infinite Ulysses site visitor or account-holder might input to the site (site use agrees to a CC license, possibly CC0; there may be an option to keep a site account-holder&#39;s inputs private from the public but not from me, limiting the possibility of bad-faith commercial reuse)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Input from user-testing surveys (users agree to CC0 on anonymized answers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any scholarly project, I&#39;m building on the work of others and putting my work out for reuse—leading to many types of information and information licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking seriously about using CC0 whenever it&#39;s a possibility, because of the chilling effect on reuse and remixing caused by a potential user needing to navigate unfamiliar or varied licensing demands. CC0 is the Creative Commons license that releases information into the public domain &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; limiting requirements such as attribution to the creator (BY), sharing any remixed/reused information under the same license as the original (share alike, or SA), or prohibiting commercial reuse (NC). Some form of CC or other free-reuse-allowing license is necessary if I actually want for someone to hypothetically duplicate my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The University and IP Rights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your university almost definitely has a policy on the licensing of intellectual property created by students and staff, so you&#39;ll want to check it out early in your project and be certain that your rights are what you think they are; preferably, get a written acknowledgment from your university&#39;s IP office or lawyer that you can file in case questions arise later on. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/docs/IV-320A.pdf&quot; &gt;university&#39;s IP policy&lt;/a&gt; is a bit unclear in my particular situation; generally, students retain rights over code created during a dissertation, but there is a clause suggesting that a student having a &quot;written agreement&quot; related to the dissertation with some other party might negate those rights. Does applying for and receiving an academic fellowship that partially supports a year of the dissertation count as a &quot;written agreement&quot;? I decided to check now instead of having trouble later, but after six weeks of emails (including several times reminding the tech IP office that they hadn&#39;t given me a response), I sent a final email identifying a deadline I&#39;d need to hear from them by, or I&#39;d consider my rights retained. That deadline passed with no word from the IP office. I&#39;m really not expecting there to be any issues; it&#39;s not like the site will be generating money or I&#39;ll be creating something that someone else will use to make money, but it&#39;s still nice to have that chain of emails for the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creative Commons? CC Zero?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons (CC) licenses are not appropriate for executed code; they weren&#39;t developed with software in mind and don&#39;t mention executable code in their language (CC actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_software.3F&quot; &gt;recommends against&lt;/a&gt; using its licenses for software). &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data#Can_databases_be_released_under_CC_licenses.3F&quot; &gt;CC licenses &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be used on databases&lt;/a&gt;, but you should &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data#When_a_CC_license_is_applied_to_a_database.2C_what_is_being_licensed.3F&quot; &gt;read about exactly what of a database is being protected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information that can be appropriately licensed by CC, digital humanists &lt;a href=&quot;http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by&quot;&gt;Bethany Nowviskie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dancohen.org/2013/11/26/cc0-by&quot;&gt;Dan Cohen&lt;/a&gt; have both written convincing arguments for licensing your work using CC0, aka CC Zero (CC0 is the Creative Commons license that releases information into the public domain without limiting requirements such as attribution to the creator (BY), sharing any remixed/reused information under the same license as the original (share alike, or SA), or prohibiting commercial reuse (NC) ). Their arguments include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the humanities, there isn&#39;t a huge risk of our work being reused for nefarious commercial profit (although the rise of MOOCs may change that); the real risk is of never being read/used, so make it easy for your work to be remixed, extended, and spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who would reuse your work in bad faith will probably do so regardless of your licensing choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forcing the potential reuser/remixer/extender to deal with a bewildering array of different licenses has a chilling effect on beneficial reuse or extension of your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Cohen advocates for using CC0 while also providing guidance in terms of best practices for your information&#39;s use (e.g. attribution isn&#39;t required by law, but it&#39;s a nice and useful thing to do). The &lt;a href=&quot;http://dp.la&quot; &gt;Digital Public Library of America&lt;/a&gt; (DPLA) offers &lt;a href=&quot;http://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DPLADataUseBestPractices.pdf&quot; &gt;a good example of an information best practices statement&lt;/a&gt;; you might use the DPLA&#39;s to model a similar (possibly shorter, given the size of your project) set of guidelines for use of your information. For my Infinite Ulysses site, I&#39;ll probably write a page showing how to attribute each type of the site&#39;s content and suggesting some ways of reusing and extending my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources for Further Reading on IP Licensing&lt;/h2&gt;

   <link href="/2013/12/02/valuespost"/>
   <updated>2013-12-02T23:37:25-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/12/02/valuespost</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Digital humanist &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scott_bot&quot; &gt;Scott Weingart&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s website includes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?page_id=3086&quot; &gt;a &quot;pledges&quot; page&lt;/a&gt; that records his definition of being a good scholarly citizen: committing to open access and open source all the time, reducing barriers to participation in and extension of his scholarly work. This is an awesome idea: publicly recording what&#39;s important to you helps regularly check that you&#39;re acting in a way that accords with your values, and not just when it&#39;s convenient (If more scholars did this, we could look at word and topic frequencies and compare individuals&#39; values to what we perceive as the values of the DH community as a whole). For example, if accessibility is important to me, I need to make certain that value is reflected in my current work, and I need to educate or reject participation in venues (conferences, projects) that don&#39;t care about accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend most of my scholarly time at present on dissertational work—web development, design, and blogging—so I want to record my values in relation to these activities. These values come across clearly in my dissertational blogging, with statements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a public, participatory humanities: &quot;I intend to build tools and digital editions that help everyone—textual scholars and the lay person—participate in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning... a more public textual studies—a textual studies that encourages participation outside of a limited circle of expertise&quot; (&lt;a title=&quot;Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design &amp; the Urgency of the Public Humanities&quot; href=&quot;/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities&quot; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On reifying and testing our theories about digital objects: &quot;We need to build these [textual] theories into our digital editions such that their innovative arguments are... empirically testable via user studies&quot; (&lt;a title=&quot;Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design &amp; the Urgency of the Public Humanities&quot; href=&quot;/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities&quot; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On allowing your work to be extended and reused: &quot;I’ll be releasing this project’s code (Drupal modules, themes) on GitHub so that anyone can reuse or modify my work in their own digital edition.&quot; (&lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: Project Precedents and Caveats&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/27/infinite-ulysses-background&quot; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&#39;m building my dissertation projects to assess textual theories, &lt;strong&gt;I need to actively check that what I build not only reflects the values I blog about, but non-verbally demonstrates them&lt;/strong&gt;. Below, I&#39;ve listed these various values in one place and tried to identify where in my dissertational projects they will be reified (I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll forget something important to me that has become a tacit part of how I work—looking forward to that inevitable discovery after posting this!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Accessibility = universal design.&lt;/strong&gt; As much as possible, design for all readers; build on existing work on usability and accessibility to create better DH-specific accessibility tutorials and standards. Library website accessibility and usability work is a fruitful place for research, as the structure and use of library websites is similar to that of a complex digital scholarly edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A public humanities&lt;/strong&gt;. Teaching is knowing; you should be able to explain your work to a non-specialist audience (without forgetting there&#39;s no &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road#A_metaphorical_.E2.80.9CRoyal_Road.E2.80.9D_in_famous_quotations&quot; &gt;royal road&lt;/a&gt; to geometry, of course! (&quot;It is too bad that [the language for explaining mathematics] has to be mathematics, and that mathematics is hard for some people. It is reputed - I do not know if it is true - that when one of the kings was trying to learn geometry from Euclid he complained that it was difficult. And Euclid said, &quot;There is no royal road to geometry&quot;. And there is no royal road. Physicists cannot make a conversion to any other language. If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in.&quot; —Richard Feynman) ). While using speculative experiments is a key methodology for at least the &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; portion of my dissertation (what happens if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?), I also want these experiments to produce deliverables useful here and now (a participatory edition for reading and discussing &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. A public humanities is a participatory humanities.&lt;/strong&gt; Our work is to preserve human culture, and preservation = propagation (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-A-Novel/dp/0307887448&quot; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Communication of our nerdy passions should be a two-way conversation, with the new questions and thoughts from readers outside our field or the academy brought into the great conversation. User-testing incorporates audience participation into the design as well as the final use of a project, but the digital humanities has been slow to establish best practices for &lt;a title=&quot;DH Evaluation: A Four-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work&quot; href=&quot;/2012/10/31/3partdheval&quot; &gt;DH-specific user-testing&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to help make user-testing easier to include in a grant timeline by exploring and consolidating best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Scholarly design and development.&lt;/strong&gt; Interface is argument: a critical act both to create and read. Building is scholarship, and while I don&#39;t believe that many works of built scholarship require replication in text to stand as intellectual contributions to the community, some sort of narrative of the methods and experience of creating the work is important to its reception and usage, and to reach a wider, non-technical community, that often means a written narrative. The benefits of reaching a wider audience by replicating your built scholarly work in an article or monograph aren&#39;t as important as getting that work done, though—so we need to advocate for student projects and dissertations to be accepted in forms other than the monograph, because the common requirement of doubling one&#39;s built scholarship with a monograph spreads a chilling effect on young scholars&#39; interest in trying design, coding, and other digital or non-monograph-form scholarly work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Design is not pre-critical.&lt;/strong&gt; When I consider an edition and what information it&#39;s trying to express, I&#39;ve moved from thinking about the narrative content of a piece of literature to aspects such as its interpretations and reception history—those features the scholarly editor foregrounds in their textual notes and methodology, aspects which a well-designed interface can support or augment. This information-centered approach requires thinking about your audience and your goals for the use of your scholarly product. What we see when we encounter an edition shapes the questions we raise, the biases we inherit, and the things we end up knowing; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.tdl.org/paj/index.php/paj/article/view/8&quot; &gt;Jon Saklofske asks&lt;/a&gt; during his reimagining of the Blake Archive interface: what are the interpretive resonances of redesign? (Saklofske, Jon. &quot;NewRadial: Revisualizing the Blake Archive&quot;. &lt;em&gt;Poetess Archive Journal&lt;/em&gt; 2.1 (December 2010).)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Accurate semantics for situating what we do.&lt;/strong&gt; Be as sensitive to how I construct non-digital or non-making scholarly work as I am to how scholarly building is often treated (e.g. &quot;developers aren&#39;t scholars, or at least not when they&#39;re coding/designing&quot;). I want to be wary of characterizing anything as &quot;traditional work&quot; or &quot;non-digital&quot;; these terms are too wide and abstract, carry connotations of datedness, and, most importantly—digital work IS traditional in the sense of following a tradition of practice (as with creating and designing editions in textual theory, or as with algorithmic criticism pre-computer, as Steve Ramsay shows in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/75tms2pw9780252036415.html&quot; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading Machines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Building and design experiments have a long history as part of the textual scholar&#39;s intellectual toolkit; it isn’t whether something is written, or can be described linguistically, that determines whether critical thought went into it and scholarly utility comes out of it: it’s the appropriateness of the form to the argument, and the availability of that argument to discussion and evaluation in the scholarly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Documentation.&lt;/strong&gt; Part of accessibility and participatory design is making your technical and design decisions/methodology understandable to people not versed in the skills you employed. Good documentation can be a fairly simple by-product of good technical practice; for example, I basically produced a guide to creating your own Islandora digital edition site just by recording all my attempts, failures, and successes as I set up my own site (with the additional benefit that I could remember what I had already tried and places I might need to go back and alter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Open source, open access: clone my work and read it too.&lt;/strong&gt; Here&#39;s a simpler way of putting it: your documentation should be so good that someone willing to put in the time and technical learning could hypothetically replicate your exact work completely (e.g. I&#39;m hoping to make it clear how to &quot;make your own Infinite Ulysses site&quot;) and more probably, create their own intellectual argument using the tools and scholarly form you documented. All code should be distributed with some license allowing at least free, non-commercial reuse (and although Creative Commons licenses aren&#39;t appropriate for code meant to be run, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by&quot;&gt;Bethany Nowviskie&#39;s argument&lt;/a&gt; for not keeping a non-commercial requirement on your work is pretty convincing). As a corollary to making my code reusable and understandable, when I do get around to publishing about my dissertation via journal articles or other peer-reviewed platforms, it&#39;s important that I retain rights to the content allowing me to make it freely available to anyone to access.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Values Reified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also write a set of blog posts exploring how each value ends up functioning as part of my dissertation and what difficulties (if any) impeded the value&#39;s inclusion (I&#39;ll come back and link each of the listed values to the posts as they are written).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you written something explaining your scholarly values? Add it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/JFJE65BA&quot; &gt;the &quot;Values&quot; folder in the Digital Humanities Zotero library&lt;/a&gt; and we can look at word and topic frequencies in digital humanist values!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Get Your Data into Gephi: A Quick and Basic Tutorial</title>
   <link href="/2013/09/09/dataintogephi"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in learning more about information visualization by trying out some yourself, here&#39;s a quick tutorial on how to get a very basic dataset showing character relationships from a piece of literature into Gephi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also check out my posts on the Bloomsday Ulysses visualization project (this year&#39;s &lt;a title=&quot;“Suppose there’s some connection”: Visualizing Character Interactions in Ulysses for Bloomsday 2013&quot; href=&quot;/2013/09/09/bloomsday2013results&quot; &gt;more in-depth analysis&lt;/a&gt;, last year&#39;s &lt;a title=&quot;O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)&quot; href=&quot;/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis&quot; &gt;smaller project&lt;/a&gt;), Gephi tutorials (&lt;a title=&quot;View DHQ: Visualizing Data from Digital Humanities Quarterly (Part I of II)&quot; href=&quot;/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt1&quot;&gt;how I used Gephi&lt;/a&gt; for my &lt;a title=&quot;Mapping the Flow of Knowledge with “View DHQ”: ACH Microgrant Award&quot; href=&quot;/2012/04/19/ach-microgrant-award&quot; &gt;&quot;View DHQ&quot;&lt;/a&gt; DH knowledge networks project, &lt;a title=&quot;View DHQ: Getting Started with Gephi for DH Vis (Part II of II)&quot; href=&quot;/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt2&quot;&gt;Gephi terminology and ideas for exploration&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ&quot;&gt;ACH Microgrant visualization work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Basic Gephi Dataset Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bloomsday project, we recorded data about what character interacted with which other characters, and used a scale of 1-7 to indicate the perceived intimacy of those interactions (e.g. from one person thinking of another person, to an involved conversation between two people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this kind of network of pairs of interacting people, the most basic relationship dataset would look like two columns on a spreadsheet, with each row containing names of two people in a relationship pair (e.g. John thought about Jim, Washington talked to Jefferson). If you&#39;re showing an equal relationship (John and Jim are paired because they had a conversation), the order of who gets placed in which of the two columns doesn&#39;t matter; if the relationship does have a direction (John sent a letter to Jim), you can think of these two columns as the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; (the name at the start of an arrow, and the name an arrow is pointing at, like John -&gt; Jim).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example of these two columns in the Bloomsday visualization dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/2col.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a slightly more nuanced visualization, you can add a column to &quot;weight&quot; the edge (the connecting line or arrow between two &quot;nodes&quot;; it&#39;s like lines and dots--edges and nodes): assign some number that &quot;weights&quot; the kind of relationship the source and target in each row had. For example, maybe you want to rate the impact relationships had on West&#39;s work, with a 1 being least impact and a 3 being most. You now can have a spreadsheet that could look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source          Target          Weight&lt;br&gt;
John              Jim              2&lt;br&gt;
John              Jane            1&lt;br&gt;
Jane              Jim              2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example of the three columns used in the Bloomsday visualization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/3col.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the following codes in that dataset (but &lt;a title=&quot;“Suppose there’s some connection”: Visualizing Character Interactions in Ulysses for Bloomsday 2013&quot; href=&quot;/2013/09/09/bloomsday2013results&quot;&gt;as I discuss in my post&lt;/a&gt; on the resulting visualizations, such coding is highly subjective and definitely be improved/made less ambiguous):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table  cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width=&quot;509&quot;&gt;
&lt;col width=&quot;282&quot;&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding for &quot;Depth&quot; of Character Interaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code to Use in Type of Interaction Column&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character thinking of another character&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character observing another character&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Omniscient third person narrator (for when two people interact, but it isn&#39;t from just one of their viewpoints)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character acknowledging another character without speaking (tip of the hat, nod, etc.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character voicing salutation to another character or other extremely brief interchange&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character entering into conversation with another character&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character having intimate contact with another character&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to take a closer look at the datasets for the Bloomsday visualizations, I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/DW4lxd&quot; &gt;open viewing of our data recording spreadsheet to the public&lt;/a&gt; (and am happy to give anyone who wishes to augment the dataset editing capability). You can also check out the CSVs I imported to Gephi (&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/WanderingRocks.csv&quot; &gt;Wandering Rocks spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/StartOfBook.csv&quot; &gt;Start of Book spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;), which have removed everything but the source, target, and weight columns; cleaned up a few errors; and been saved as CSV files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Do I Get My Data into Gephi?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save your spreadsheet as a CSV (in Google Spreadsheet, File &gt; Download As &gt; CSV). Open up Gephi. (If you&#39;re on a Mac, you&#39;ll probably need to download the 0.8.1beta version of Gephi as of Septmeber 2013, since it doesn&#39;t seem to work on OSX--freezes on the data laboratory screen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the &quot;start a new project&quot; option in the pop-up screen. Look at the top to see three tabs, with &quot;Data Laboratory&quot; being the middle tab; click on it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit lower and to the left under the tab you just clicked will be an &quot;import spreadsheet&quot; button. Click it and navigate to your CSV file. Under &quot;as table&quot;, choose &quot;edges table&quot;. Click next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure weight, label, and create missing nodes are checked, and click finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more step! At the bottom of the page, click on the &quot;copy data to other column&quot; button and choose &quot;ID&quot;. In the box that pops up, make sure &quot;label&quot; is chosen and click okay. This will place a label on each node (dot) with the name of the person represented by that dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, go back to those three tabs at the top of the screen and click on &quot;overview&quot; to play around with the layout of your data, and later on click on the &quot;preview&quot; tab to see how your final visualization will look and download an image file of the visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;View DHQ: Getting Started with Gephi for DH Vis (Part II of II)&quot; href=&quot;/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt2&quot;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; has more on what to do once you&#39;ve got your dataset imported into Gephi, as well as links to other people&#39;s less basic Gpehi tutorials.

   <id>/2013/09/09/bloomsday2013results</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For this year&#39;s Bloomsday, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/Rajarmstrong&quot; &gt;Rhonda Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/reginahiggins&quot; &gt;Regina Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, Steven Hoelscher, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/Plandrews14&quot; &gt;Pamela Andrews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot; &gt;I&lt;/a&gt; collaborated digitally to extend the &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; dataset and visualization work begun at THATCamp Prime 2012 (aka Bloomsday 2012). Rhonda, Regina, Steven, and Pamela each thoroughly scoured ten pages of the book to add to our knowledge about the network of character relationships in the novel, and I extended last year&#39;s &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; visualization (off of the data created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/ChadRut&quot; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chad Rutkowski&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and me in 2012), adding in weights showing the &quot;depth&quot; of each character interaction. A huge thank-you to Rhonda, Regina, Steven, and Pamela for their time and effort expanding the public dataset of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; character interactions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; You can start immediately below with reading my meta-analysis of the project (basically, how a non-weekend viz project might attack the same problem), &lt;a href=&quot;#viz&quot;&gt;jump down to inspect the visualizations&lt;/a&gt;, or jump even farther to &lt;a href=&quot;#instructions&quot;&gt;read the instructions and suggestions&lt;/a&gt; I shared with this year&#39;s scholars (including an explanation of the &quot;weight&quot; system we used to record a subjective depth to each character interaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;You can &lt;a title=&quot;O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)&quot; href=&quot;/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis&quot;&gt;check out last year&#39;s Bloomsday visualization work&lt;/a&gt;, or read the tutorials (&lt;a title=&quot;View DHQ: Visualizing Data from Digital Humanities Quarterly (Part I of II)&quot; href=&quot;/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;View DHQ: Getting Started with Gephi for DH Vis (Part II of II)&quot; href=&quot;/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) for making basic Gephi (infoviz software) visualizations that I created as part of &lt;a title=&quot;Mapping the Flow of Knowledge with “View DHQ”: ACH Microgrant Award&quot; href=&quot;/2012/04/19/ach-microgrant-award&quot;&gt;my ACH Microgrant work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons from the Mini-Project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The big caveats with the dataset&lt;/strong&gt; were caused by my decision to assign volunteers ten-page sections before the actual event: people needed to use the edition of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; they had on hand (which meant assigning increments of ten pages to different people meant different, possibly overlapping, sections of the book were covered), and because some people needed to drop out of participating before Bloomsday, there are gaps in coverage (e.g. pages 1-10 aren&#39;t covered). The current dataset covers the following pieces of the book: pages 11-40 and 101-110 (1990 Vintage edition), pages 71-80 (the Project Gutenberg e-text), and pages 81-90 (1961 Modern Library edition)...plus all of &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I probably should have handled dividing pages differently—a better way to handle page numbering: wait until the day of the event to assign pages to those who are still participating, and either require use of the same edition (maybe by scanning and sending out the needed pages to volunteers, so no has the barrier to participation of needing to buy a different edition of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;) or falling back to the non-authoritative Project Gutenberg e-text (easy to copy and paste different sections of the text into emails to the different participants; flaws of this version of the text don&#39;t majorly impact our character relationship recording activities). On the other hand, much of the interest in helping out with this project is tied to a desire to (re)read &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, and letting scholars use their preferred edition is important to that reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I do this project again? Absolutely! The participants were amazing collaborators, volunteering their time and effort to expand a public dataset, and having a chance to learn just a bit more about information visualization is always a treat. Next time, though, I&#39;ll need to take more time planning out more thorough coverage of a single edition of the work. I&#39;d also spend more time packaging our finished data for use by others (e.g. those with more Gephi chops than me). I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pndZ58IrPtxJi7MsF4fzSQ4TKroCQPrONYo2H989Gk/edit#gid=2&quot; &gt;open viewing of our data recording spreadsheet to the public&lt;/a&gt; (and am happy to give anyone who wishes to augment the dataset editing capability). You can also check out the CSVs I imported to Gephi (&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/WanderingRocks.csv&quot; &gt;Wandering Rocks spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/StartOfBook.csv&quot; &gt;Start of Book spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;), which put the data we gathered in the Google Spreadsheet into Gephi-ingestable form (and fix a few redundant variant-spellings and the like). Given its issues (gaps in page coverage, data from different editions), I didn&#39;t actively court anyone to use our data. Next time, with better coverage of the book, I&#39;d reach out to DH tweeps who work more regularly in infoviz to help augment and use the data. &lt;strong&gt;But!&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to work with any of the data or visualizations images, please go ahead! This post, the dataset on GoogleDocs, the two CSVs linked above, and the three visualization images in this post are all CC BY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Visualizations without explanation? (Sacrilege!) &lt;/strong&gt;Given the holiday and learning nature of this project, we didn&#39;t approach it with quite the same end goal as most &quot;proper&quot; visualization projects (by which I mean, scholarship with project-length time and effort, producing an end result of narrated new knowledge). The data creation by the team&#39;s scholars was rigorous under the given parameters of a defined but sometimes ambiguous weight spectrum and non-continuous selections from the novel, but it was also a weekend project: looking at the visualizations below, I can confirm some expectations and enjoy getting an unusually broad view of the network of the novel&#39;s socializing, but there is much more someone with the time and interest can do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full visualization project would benefit from continuous data, or at least data with interesting ways of separating non-continuous sets of pages (e.g. all sections when Stephen is physically present as a way of looking on his effect on social interaction). Some things we&#39;d do with more time to devote to this project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#39;d &lt;strong&gt;analyze the different interaction-type encodings&lt;/strong&gt; and their placement along a spectrum of relationship intimacy, probably coming up with a better set of weights and a more convincing and clear narrative for each of the interaction types on that scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#39;d &lt;strong&gt;predict the visualizations&#39; appearances, and analyze how the actual visualization differed and why&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as discuss other types of new knowledge gained or gainable from the visualization—or &lt;strong&gt;what data was missing&lt;/strong&gt; that could make new knowledge possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#39;d also &lt;strong&gt;discuss the algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; used to produce the visualizations, something I&#39;m not (yet!) able to do that is of &lt;em&gt;tantamount importance&lt;/em&gt; to scholarly visualization (as with any work that sues a tool, you need to understand how the tool functions to understand its results, its possible biases and blindspots, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could &lt;strong&gt;compare the visualization results of multiple layout algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;, and analyze their different visual arguments or different aspects of character relationships they variously highlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s by no means an exhaustive list, and again, I feel that this kind of dipping ones toes into the waters of a new technique is important—as long as you are aware of what, if any, arguments you&#39;re trying to make with your scholarly (or weekend scholar) production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Gephi problems!&lt;/strong&gt; The current version of Gephi (0.8.2beta) wasn&#39;t working on OSX 10.8.4; it loads fine but freezes on the data laboratory screen. I reverted to an older version (0.8.1beta) that works fine, after losing some time trying to get things working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The subjectivity of placing types of relationship interactions along a spectrum&lt;/strong&gt; (or even just of placing character interactions into &quot;types&quot;) could definitely benefit from more debate and detail (see below for a table of the interaction coding we used—I think we came up with it during THATCamp Prime 2012?). The spectrum as it stands has several issues. The sometimes-directionality of the weights made it difficult to know when to record more than one interaction; the codes have both one-way interactions types (X thinks about Y) and two-way interactions (X and Y have a conversation). The interaction code &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;Omniscient third person narrator (for when two people interact, but it isn&#39;t from just one of their viewpoints)&quot;, was meant to control for directionality and make &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; designations meaningful, but didn&#39;t end up being useful because interaction codes 4-7 were ambiguous as to direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relatedly subjective issue arose from the choice of node names; for example, the woman&#39;s arm that flings a coin to the one-legged sailor clearly belongs to Molly (though maybe not clearly at that point in one&#39;s reading)—should that interaction accrue to the &quot;Molly&quot; node, or should a second &quot;her&quot; node be created? Other portions of the book would provide similar problems (e.g. Martha Clifford/Nurse Callan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;viz&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Visualizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualization A, Wandering Rocks Redux. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Click image to view larger.)&lt;/em&gt; A visualization of characters interacting with other characters in the &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; chapter (all pages of chapter covered), with lines weighted by &quot;depth&quot; of the interaction: more intimate encounters have a heavier weight, while &quot;lighter&quot; encounters (e.g. character thinks of another characters or salutes them but does not converse) have lighter connecting lines. See the &quot;Instructions&quot; section below for more on this weighting process. (&lt;em&gt;This visualization augments &lt;a title=&quot;O rocks!

Again, lines are weighted by &quot;depth&quot; of the interaction: more intimate encounters have a heavier weight.&lt;br&gt;

The visualization above shows a node for each character recorded, which makes it less readable. Below, I filtered the dataset to only show those characters who interacted with more than one other person (in Gephi, go to filters &gt; topology &gt; degree range and set how many edges a node must have to appear), giving an easier view of the major socializers in this part of the book (again, lines are weighted with thicker lines showing more intimate interaction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Instructions for Gathering Data on Character Interactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructions I sent to the other members of the team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.&lt;b&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Each of you should have access to the Bloomsday InfoViz spreadsheet&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; where you can see who&#39;s been assigned which pages/sections of the book and record your data (check your inbox for a link sent by Google). Please feel very free to take a different or additional set of pages, or do a smaller or larger number of pages than you volunteered for—just make a note on the spreadsheet so we don&#39;t do redundant work. Note that the spreadsheet has three different sheets (tabs at the bottom of the page): one for claiming pages, one for recording your data, and one with info on how to code the type of character interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. There&#39;s a bit of difficulty in working together with potentially different editions/page numbers of the book. If you could each&lt;b&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;let me know the publisher/year of the copy of Ulysses you&#39;re using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (on the spreadsheet&#39;s first sheet), I&#39;ll make sure we&#39;re not accidentally overlapping [well, that turned out to be too difficult...]. Alternatively or in addition to reading from a print book, you might copy and paste the chunk you want to work on from the Project Gutenberg e-text into a word document; I find this makes skimming for character interactions easier, since you can go through and highlight things. The e-text doesn&#39;t have page numbers as far as a I recall, so if you work this way please just let me know the sentence you start and end on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read or skim for character interactions!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (See below for details*.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Record the interactions you read on the spreadsheet&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;The columns are used as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Person [Source]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interacts with This Person [Target]&lt;/b&gt;: for people speaking to each other, no need to write things twice—that is, when Stephen and Mulligan talk on top of the tower at the start of the book, just record one row with Stephen in either column 1 or 2 and Mulligan the same (the &quot;type of interaction&quot; code will let us know whether it&#39;s a directional interaction—that is, person in column 1 is thinking of person in column 2—or a mutual interaction such as a dialogue)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Type of Interaction&lt;/b&gt;: See the third sheet (tab at the bottom of the spreadsheet that says &quot;Codes for Character Interactions&quot; for info on how to code types of interaction here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Episode or Page Numbers:&lt;/b&gt; Note which episode or range of page numbers in which this interaction occurs (no need to mark specific page number; you can just record e.g. that something occurred in your range of pages 80-99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edition (Publisher, Date) of Book Used&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who Did This Work?: &lt;/b&gt;Your name (so we can credit you for your contribution!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;* So what&#39;s an interaction?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#39;re treating an &quot;interaction&quot; as some type of interchange between two characters; if more than two characters are interacting, please break these into pairs of two characters that represent all interactions going on and record the two names with one name in column 1 and the other name in column 2 (this will let our software draw lines between each pairing of characters). For example, when Haines, Mulligan, and Stephen eat breakfast together in the first chapter of the book, you&#39;d add three rows: Haines and Mulligan, Haines and Stephen, Mulligan and Stephen. Note that for people speaking to each other, no need to write things twice—that is, when Stephen and Mulligan talk on top of the tower at the start of the book, just record one row with Stephen in either column 1 or 2 and Mulligan in the other column; the &quot;type of interaction&quot; code will let us know whether it&#39;s a directional interaction—that is, person in column 1 is thinking of person in column 2—or a mutual interaction such as a dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deciding when interactions between characters start and end will have to be a bit subjective—just use your best judgement.&lt;/b&gt; An &quot;interaction&quot; is a chunk of communication such as a dialogue, a speech directed at one or more specific characters, or thinking about an absent character; &quot;chunk&quot; means that we&#39;ll think of an interaction as ending (allowing a new one that occurs later to be recorded as a separate interaction) when communication ends, other events intervene, or the thinker starts thinking about something or someone else. for example: Does Bloom think about Molly while walking along the street, and then think about other stuff, and then think about Molly again? I&#39;d count that as two interactions. Among other interactions in the opening chapter (&quot;Telemachus&quot;), Stephen and Mulligan talk on the roof of the tower, then Stephen is left alone (and thinks about Mulligan), and then Stephen and Mulligan have a different interaction (breakfast with Haines) downstairs; I&#39;d count those as three different interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;You don&#39;t need to spend time agonizing over where interactions end and what type of interaction took place—&lt;/b&gt;just use your best judgement and have fun! If you&#39;re really unsure, leave a brief note in the &quot;comments&quot; column to the right of the row with the questionable interaction and I can check it out. The idea is to get as rich a recording of interactions as possible (e.g. to get a sense of how often thoughts of Molly invade Bloom&#39;s day) without, for example, recording every line of a dialogue as a separate interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Codes for Character Interactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coded interactions by number along a highly subjective spectrum of relationship depth (see &quot;Lessons&quot; section above for some of the issues that rose from this coding):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!--&lt;br&gt;
br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}&lt;br&gt;
--&gt;&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table  cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width=&quot;509&quot;&gt;
&lt;col width=&quot;282&quot;&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding for Type of Character Interaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code to Use in Type of Interaction Column&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character thinking of another character&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character observing another character&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Omniscient third person narrator (for when two people interact, but it isn&#39;t from just one of their viewpoints)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character acknowledging another character without speaking (tip of the hat, nod, etc.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character voicing salutation to another character or other extremely brief interchange&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character entering into conversation with another character&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character having intimate contact with another character&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy (belated) Bloomsday!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <updated>2013-08-26T08:00:25-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/08/26/bitcuratordigitalforensics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just started work on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Bitcurator.net&quot; &gt;Bitcurator&lt;/a&gt; project at &lt;a href=&quot;http:/mith.umd.edu&quot; &gt;MITH&lt;/a&gt;; to give you a sense of what I&#39;m doing, here are my tweets explaining, defining, and relating this information science work to humanists (skip down for more on digital forensics ethics if you&#39;ve already seen the tweets!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.@Bitcurator&lt;/a&gt;: building an inexpensive, easy-to-use digital forensics toolkit for info professionals working w/born-digital collections.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Amanda Visconti (@Literature_Geek) August 21, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bundle OS tools, design GUI &amp; documentation for libraries/archives, add forensics to the digital archive workflow w/eye toward public access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is digital forensics? Recovery &amp; investigation of digital files &amp; environment, e.g. emails &amp; DOCs, hidden/erased/dated files, metadata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are born-digital materials? Anything generated digitally, e.g.:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emails btw author &amp; editor, a laptop where a book was drafted, digital poem drafts, browser history from an author&#39;s surfing for inspiration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Taking off my info hat &amp; donning my literature one, what&#39;s interesting about digital forensics + born-digital collections for humanists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A1. Context for authors&#39; writing. As w/physical environs of an author, her digital environment: wallpaper, mp3s played while writing, emails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A2. Regaining access to creative or scholarly work &quot;lost&quot; on defunct types of digital storage like floppies and zip drives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more about @Bitcurator at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitcurator.net&quot;&gt;bitcurator.net, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitcurator.net/building-a-digital-curation-workstation-with-bitcurator-update&quot;&gt;@pwolsen&#39;s [nicely illustrated] post on creating a digital forensics workstation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m working on web design/dev, usability, documentation, and community-building for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ethics for Digital Forensic Archival Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been reading up on digital forensics in the archive, and one of the most interesting topics to me is how digital archivists explain the full possibilities of digital forensics work to potential donors—when an author brings an archive the laptop they used to draft a famous novel, how do archivists go about concisely but ethically explaining what kind of knowledge future researchers could potentially extract from their data? (I&#39;m fully confident in the ethics of archive professionals; I&#39;m just wondering how such risks are concisely explained and contrasted against potential future benefits of handing over a lot of an author&#39;s personal data. What do donor agreements for digital gifts look like? I did some research!) The limitless possibilities for working with all the data on an author&#39;s laptop fascinate me—with the author&#39;s drafts alongside her emails, music playlists, calendar schedules, and every other aspect of modern life people keep on their computers, &lt;strong&gt;you could potentially draw out a detailed illustration of that author&#39;s writing practices (did they write only in the middle of the night? how did email arguments with publishers affect the amount of creative work they were getting done?), or track down just when some crucial idea was first typed and saved (while listening to a certain album? after visiting certain pages on Wikipedia?).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, all this possibility for recreating the context of authorial processes feels a lot more creepy when it concerns people alive today, not some Victorian author whose letters, date book, and diary were recovered from an attic. Best practice dictates that developing a relationship of trust with the donor and thoroughly documenting their wishes in a written donor agreement can go a long way toward helping future archivists evaluate whether new data analysis techniques would be in keeping with the donor&#39;s privacy needs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub149&quot; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a white paper by Matthew Kirschenbaum, Richard Ovenden, and Gabriela Redwine, explores this ethical issue as well as others. In this paper, Cal Lee provided an impressive list of hidden forms of data lurking just in the Microsoft Office Suite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Forms of data that may be hidden from users include information about the application used to create a document; authors, user names, organizational affiliations, and author history; comments; custom properties; database queries; embedded objects (OLE); Fast Save—that is, change history appended to the end of a file, rather than applied to the body of a document; the GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) for the originating computer; hidden cells, slides, and text (purposely hidden but then possibly forgotten); Outlook (e-mail) properties and routing slips; path information, including audio and video paths, author history, linked objects, printers, hyperlinks, and included fields; presentation notes; printer driver information; RSID (Revision Save ID), which differentiates changes from different editing sessions); tracked changes (added to PowerPoint and Excel in Office XP) versions; Visual Basic code, including macros and viruses (and the identity of the code’s creators); Web server information; and white text (on white background). (List provided by Cal Lee. Pages 45-46 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub149&quot; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a white paper by Matthew Kirschenbaum, Richard Ovenden, and Gabriela Redwine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&#39;s important to get across the full extent of risk when handing over storage devices to research archives, it&#39;s also important to show the benefits of providing seemingly unimportant contextual data to future researchers. &lt;em&gt;Digital Forensics&lt;/em&gt; mentions that Emory uses the phrase &quot;data analysis&quot; instead of &quot;digital forensics&quot;, as becoming the subject of a forensics investigation sounds much less inviting than having the context of one&#39;s authorial process recreated and explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked over the donor agreements MITH created for Deena Larsen and Bill Bly&#39;s gifts to our collection of pioneering e-lit and digital writing context; &lt;em&gt;Digital Forensics&lt;/em&gt; also linked to some online examples of donor agreements, including&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/appendices/gift-agreement.html&quot; &gt;The Paradigm Project&lt;/a&gt; (archives from major UK political parties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendoar.org/tools/en/policies.php&quot;&gt;OpenDOAR&lt;/a&gt;, (the Directory of Open Access Repositories) which offers a nice checkbox questionnaire to help you generate your own digital materials donor agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://variablemediaquestionnaire.net&quot;&gt;The Variable Media Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;, an environment for recording descriptive information about born-digital materials, including interviews with creators that allow a case-by-case record of what authors identify as the significant properties of their creative digital work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last project takes an interesting stance on digital preservation, helping archivists record how and if they want the object to be emulated or otherwise recreated in the future: &quot;The variable media paradigm also asks creators to choose the most appropriate strategy for dealing with the inevitable slippage that results from translating to new mediums: storage (mothballing a PC), emulation (playing Pong on your laptop), migration (putting Super-8 on DVD), or reinterpretation (Hamlet in a chat room).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Thinking Through Making: More Precedents for Scholarly Experimentation as Critical Work</title>
   <link href="/2013/08/19/scholarlyexperimentation"/>
   <updated>2013-08-19T08:00:44-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/08/19/scholarlyexperimentation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve &lt;a title=&quot;Experimental Editions: Digital Editions as Methodological Prototypes&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/26/experimental-editions&quot;&gt;written previously&lt;/a&gt; about how experiments and new methods with textual editions and tools function as scholarly arguments; in this post I&#39;ll give a few more examples of how experimental humanities building beyond digital editions can act as critical argument. I&#39;ll also discuss precedents for dissertational making as scholarship that doesn&#39;t require duplication in monograph form. Hoping these provide a starting place for others building an argument for starting similarly practice-focused dissertations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;Speculative computing and timely experiments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Speculative computing” is a flavor of digital humanities that emphasizes the subjective, the aesthetic, and the non-computational in humanities computing work. While on the one hand relying on an experimental or provocational approach somewhat unfamiliar to the traditional humanist, speculative computing is a response to what humanists saw as the loss of subjectivity and aesthetics experienced by the humanities as it came into contact with the algorithms, code, and objectivity of computer science (Drucker, Johanna. &lt;em&gt;Speclab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing&lt;/em&gt;. University of Chicago Press, 2009.) (Burdick, Anne, et al. &lt;em&gt;Digital_Humanities&lt;/em&gt;. MIT Press, 2012.). A similar approach, speculative design, imagines future challenges and opportunities—as with my designing a digital edition that could handle a hypothetical public wildly interested in annotating a complex text—and builds design solutions both imbued with theoretical innovation and the possibility of future utility (Lukens, Jonathan and Carl DiSalvo. “Speculative Design and Technological Fluency”.&lt;em&gt; IJLM&lt;/em&gt; 3.4 (2012). 23-40.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less speculative, more immediately applicable experimental work is routinely pursued by major digital humanities centers such as my workplace, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu&quot; &gt;Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;. As DH centers moved from sites of service to sites of inquiry over the past twenty years, so too has humanities work shifted to include digital projects not just as means to literary understanding, but as embodying literary arguments themselves. In addition to the larger projects pursued by DH centers, smaller interventions by individuals and student groups are also common in the digital humanities; Jean Bauer’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeanbauer.com/davila.html&quot; &gt;DAVILA&lt;/a&gt; is a digital overlay for DH project databases that reveals the critical choices inherent in relational database structure to non-developers, and the Praxis Program’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://prism.scholarslab.org&quot; &gt;Prism&lt;/a&gt; visualizes the intersection of many interpretations of a common text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precedents for dissertational making as scholarship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While dissertations focused on experiments (such as medical studies or the creation of a programming language aimed at a specific computing problem) are fairly normal in non-humanities fields, a dissertation that centers itself on building as much as mine does—building that does not also require a complete doubling of work effort in the form of an accompanying book-length dissertation—is still rare within the humanities (although monographs plus digital building work has become fairly normal). This is not at all to say that such work is without precedent, of course—coding as scholarly work is largely an accepted method within the field of digital humanities. It&#39;s digital building within the strictures of the dissertation that has yet to acquire methodological normalcy, for reasons ranging from the values of the granting body (most humanities PhDs are in non-digitally centered programs such as literature and history, rather than digital humanities departments), to the problems of evaluating non-monograph writing, to the all-too-often real need to conceive one&#39;s dissertation as a stepping stone towards a tenure-track teaching job (with the risk of embarking on work that colleagues might not recognize as valid, or not know how to evaluate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the most traditional literature departments, though, there is a precedent for thesis work focused on producing a scholarly object instead of only a written piece; a dissertation focused on producing a scholarly edition of a literary text has long been accepted as a valid final product (I imagine the same is true in other humanities fields such as history). To illustrate the trend toward dissertations deeply intertwined with their digital components, consider a current and a former member of my department (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.umd.edu&quot; &gt;English Department&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Maryland): my advisor Matthew Kirschenbaum’s 1999 digital dissertation was the first at the University of Virginia and one of the first in the country, and UMD alumna Tanya Clement’s 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/9160&quot; &gt;dissertation&lt;/a&gt; made strong use of digital editing and modeling tools. My diverse background in information science, web design/development, and user studies helps me pursue what is, for a humanities dissertation, a non-traditional but effective and historically inevitable method of inquiry. In my next post, I&#39;ll discuss the current conversation around non-traditional (i.e. non-monograph) forms of scholarly production: do all digital scholarly objects require a written narrative, or do some projects incorporate analysis without a side serving of text?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Digital dissertation deliverables (and how to complete them!)</title>
   <link href="/2013/08/14/timeandscope"/>
   <updated>2013-08-14T08:00:35-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/08/14/timeandscope</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does a code-focused digital dissertation look like when it&#39;s done? And without chapters to divide the work ahead of you, how do you keep your doctoral research on track? I&#39;m sharing the list of deliverables I&#39;m creating for my dissertation, as well as some practices that have helped me keep being excited about my project and eager to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital deliverables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dissertation is currently divided into three major coding projects: &quot;Infinite Ulysses&quot;, &quot;Choose Your Own Edition&quot;, and &quot;Material Editions&quot; (Note: &lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; site is part of that project.&lt;/em&gt;). The coding and design in this dissertation is scholarly work exploring how digital interfaces effect our use of textual editions, so I will not be doubling this critical effort by creating the traditional monograph-length written work alongside these scholarly digital objects. There will be lots of blogging arising naturally out of the process, though, and I&#39;ll be polishing these blogs into three articles aimed at scholarly journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there are few if any examples of delineated digital dissertation workloads out there, I&#39;m sharing mine both as a guide for other dissertators and as an example to show your advisor or department when attempting something similar (as this workload does come with the approval of my advisor, committee, and department as adequately fulfilling the requirements of a dissertation). My completed dissertation should consist of the following components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;A written introduction to the entire dissertation’s methodology, research questions, theoretical grounding, and goals. Length estimated at 20 pages, with much of the theoretical discussion specific to each of the three projects held over to those projects’ individual introductions/about text on their websites. (Most of this written foundation was completed through my 18-page prospectus and early dissertation blogging, but I&#39;ll need to rework portions of that writing after all the work is done.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of the three coding projects, a scholarly, article-length (30-60 page) write-up aimed at future publication, drawn largely from blogging during the code, design, and testing work on each project. Each article will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;a literature review situating the coding project as building on a tradition of editing and literary theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;a history of specific scholarly precedents in both print and digital space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;research questions for the project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;a rationale for any technical choices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;curated selections from academic blogging completed during the building process (to record scholarly considerations as the code progresses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;results of a short quantitative and qualitative user study matching real scholars and students with the tool, plus next steps suggested by these results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;A link to a public repository containing the code for the finished projects, as well as a sandbox website(s) where the tools can be explored in either working or prototyped form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;A written conclusion on the theoretical and practical successes, failures, and next steps for the overall dissertation project (length estimated at 15-30 pages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blogging!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging twice a month splits the brunt of content generation up over the entire course of the dissertation; this regular writing also helps me generate some interest in my work, get feedback and feature requests during the initial design phase, and feel accountable to my self-imposed schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of getting writing done by typing small amounts regularly throughout my coding work, not having a huge stretch of writing waiting for me at the end of each project is nice, but even better, capturing what I&#39;ve been thinking about during each stage of the process will render my final record more accurate (and useful to other dissertators) than trying to remember what the process felt like, where I got stuck, and when I was struck with new ideas. Because the process of critical building is as important as the product, using the blogs to set down and recognize how things are going before a final debriefing helps the entire process truly be a critical one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pseudo-agility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working on a Braille translation plugin for &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/3-1/making-the-digital-humanities-more-open-modeling-digital-humanities-for-a-wider-audience&quot;&gt;Making the Digital Humanities More Open&lt;/a&gt;, MITH&#39;s Software Architect Jim Smith taught me some elements of a work process drawn from agile software development that have been a great help in organizing my dissertation work and keeping the dissertation from (thusfar) being a stressful process. One of the techniques Jim shared was a way of scheduling work that kept priorities on the top of the work pile, while also allowing breathing room, preventing late-nighters, and otherwise recognizing human limits. With my dissertation, I&#39;ve applied this technique by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;setting monthly milestones&lt;/strong&gt; (what tasks could reasonably be done by the end of the month?);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prioritizing tasks&lt;/strong&gt; by several degrees of importance (helping me identify what things I should expend extra energy to finish if they&#39;re not complete at the milestone, and what tasks might end up being out of the project&#39;s scope—a real help with a project that has so many possible features!); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;breaking work into sprint-like microtasks&lt;/strong&gt; by assessing the difficulty of each task, estimating the time it will take to complete (and then often multiplying that by two), and making sure each task fits into at most four hours of work (if something sounds like it will take longer than four hours, it needs to be broken into smaller tasks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process helps me have a sense of what &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to be complete by the end of the month for the project to move on, and what things would only be nice to have finished by that time (and if they&#39;re not, they get dropped, not pushed into next month&#39;s task list and making it even bigger and less manageable). I&#39;m sure there are other great ways to organize your dissertation tech work (true agile development, for example)—but these three steps help me regularly reassess my work as well as regularly reward myself for my work through free time: if I finish all my assigned tasks in a week, I stop working on the dissertation and do something else until the next week starts (well, that only happens sometimes—I&#39;m also a fan of frontloading a month&#39;s work and then taking a bigger chunk of time off at the end of each month, but I only do that when I&#39;m really enjoying the work and don&#39;t need the break).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t plan ahead too minutely: take your work a month at a time&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create major monthly milestones for your entire project by setting a few very top-level goals, but don&#39;t spend time elaborating on the sub-tasks of later milestones; these will have changed by several months into your project and aren&#39;t worth spending time on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While finalizing my prospectus, I did lay out a month-by-month schedule of tasks to make sure everything seemed to fit: could I time a beta release of my site to coincide with my MLA presentation/demo? was there enough time at the end of each project to not only conduct user testing, but do further code and design work in response to the tests&#39; results? I was able to arrange the three projects so that I could spend one year on the first one (Infinite Ulysses, both the most ambitious project and the project that should be most polished by my defense), with half a year on each of the other projects allowing me to create prototypes, but not necessarily stand-alone unbreakable final products. After that initial check as to the reasonableness of my ambitions, I&#39;ve focused my planning time just on that first project. At the start of each month, I plan what I want to have completed by the end of the month, adjust the monthly task list accordingly, and label my tasks by difficulty and priority. (Using TaskPaper for my private dissertation timeline is great because I can tag tasks in a variety of ways and pull them up accordingly. Just enough time for an easy task? Command-F &quot;@easy&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public versus private timelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t announced a public timeline for release of my work yet, and don&#39;t plan to until I can see the end of the tunnel in terms of pushing the Infinite Ulysses site live. Digital work forces additional variables into the already mutable timeline of dissertating: I want to advance my technical skills with this research, so I&#39;ll be doing some things code-wise that I haven&#39;t done before and don&#39;t know how long they&#39;ll take; the time it takes to recruit site testers, run user testing, and respond to the results is unclear; and I might have so much more I want to do by the end of this first project that I decide extend it into the second year of my dissertation. One of the nuggets of tech-planning wisdom Patrick Murray-John gave the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneweekonetool.org&quot; &gt;One Week | One Tool&lt;/a&gt; team was to give the public some indication of your plans for a project, but make that timeline much more high-level than the internal schedule by which the work actually gets done. Once the Infinite Ulysses site goes live, I&#39;ll post my plans in terms of taking feedback and adding requested features, but before then I&#39;m reserving the right to take as much time as is needed to do a fantastic job. (Release hint, though: it&#39;d be awful nice to have a beta site live when I present on the Infinite Ulysses project at MLA 2014...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your mentors in the loop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve shared a GoogleDoc containing my monthly timeline (created while polishing the dissertation prospectus (A prospectus is a dissertator&#39;s written plan and rationale for her dissertation, submitted to both committee and department at the start of her work: both a roadmap and a promise)) with my advisors. While I was was out of state over the summer, it was a way to give them a sense of what I&#39;m doing in a given month, since instead of the traditional &quot;writing/editing a chapter&quot; I might be messing with a local server, writing new code, designing a site, writing and running user tests, blogging... and since I leave tasks on the timeline but strike them out when they&#39;ve been completed, it&#39;s a nice way for me to look back and see what I was doing at a given point (and feel a little proud for everything I&#39;ve already done towards the dissertation). The shared timeline also gives me just enough of an accountability reminder that I think very hard about putting off tasks assigned for the given month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>#OWOT a Week: Introducing Serendip-o-matic, a Tool for Digital Humanities Discovery and Delight</title>
   <link href="/2013/08/02/owot-a-week"/>
   <updated>2013-08-02T17:02:32-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/08/02/owot-a-week</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One Week | One Tool, the digital humanities barn-raising, is wrapping up; we released the tool we built in less than a week (Tuesday afternoon through Friday afternoon, to be exact), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.serendip-o-matic.com&quot; &gt;Serendip-o-matic.&lt;/a&gt; Head on over to the site to check it out and let your sources surprise you--I recommend trying both the option to take your Zotero library for a spin, and also submitting some beloved text like song lyrics or a book chapter. You might even try an interesting Wikipedia article and discover some new branches of information to explore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of http://serendip-o-matic.com/&quot; src=&quot;/assets/serendipomaticscreenshot-300x210.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;210&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The front page of the tool we created, serendip-o-matic.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site visitors are already tweeting screenshots of their results, and some have even advanced their research with their first visit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Congratulations &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mia_out&quot;&gt;@mia_out&lt;/a&gt; and the team of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/OWOT?src=hash&quot;&gt;#OWOT&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/cNbCbEKlUf&quot;&gt;http://t.co/cNbCbEKlUf&lt;/a&gt; Already try it &amp;amp; got new sources about a Portuguese King. GREAT!!!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Daniel Alves (@DanielAlvesFCSH) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DanielAlvesFCSH/status/363386579722567681&quot;&gt;August 2, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re all exhausted and full of new knowledge and very happy with our work. Before he head out to a celebratory dinner not at The Well (the hotel bar where we had to grab most of our meals this week), I&#39;m capturing a few notes on the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of OWOT dev team members working hotel room.&quot; src=&quot;/assets/owothotelroom.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Coding in a hotel room after we got kicked out of the hotel restaurant for eating pizza delivered from outside. Photo by team member Brian Croxall?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Project Ideas, Criteria, and Projects vs. Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing a working tool was an awesome experience, but Monday and Tuesday&#39;s debates before we decided on our project was also a useful experience. We talked about the gaps in our digital experience and what tools might fill them, and developed very high-level pseudocode-type explanations for how the ten or so ideas that made it to public voting would work--work we hope to capture and submit to the developing DiRT DH tool wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criteria for choosing the tool included&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work our skills allowed (no mobile apps meant nixing the oral history recording idea),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessibility,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;text-centrism (could we work with images or audio?),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scope (could we deploy the tool in a few days?),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;would the tool actually be used? (what people say they want can be different from what they&#39;d actually use; sometimes creating a tool creates or reveals a need),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an interface that allowed users to quickly try the tool without reading too much textual documentation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ease of explanation for marketing purposes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: immediately below are photos from the process of choosing which tool we&#39;d build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of whiteboard during One Week One Tool planning and dev work.&quot; src=&quot;/assets/owot1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CC0 Amanda Visconti)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another take-away from earlier in the week was the difference between brainstorming projects and tools: often we generated ideas that involved generating or creating structures for content, such as an archive for audio descriptions of visual art for blind museum-goers, or a place to list DH dream-tool ideas so that bored DH coders could get inspiration for work that would serve the community. I realized that often my ideas for DH creations are &lt;em&gt;projects&lt;/em&gt; and not tools, or at least somewhere in a gray area in-between, with the code work closely tied to the generation of inclusion of specific topic (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, for example). This might have something to do with my skillset, which is weighted toward interface development and design, but it reminded me it might be interesting to create a DH object that can be applied to multiple research areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coding Schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick glance at graphs of our code commits to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chnm/serendipomatic&quot; &gt;the Github repository&lt;/a&gt; over the week shows a predictable trend (and some Friday 3am coding!):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/commits.jpg&quot; width=&quot;597&quot; height=&quot;328&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/dots.jpg&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height=&quot;334&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hippos, Mustaches, and J.K Rowling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As commit messages started to shoot out quicker and closer to the deadline, clarity decreased. We ended up making a lot of small commits to make sure everyone was working with the same code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/hippo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/bugs.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used a photo of J.K. Rowling as a filler for results without images; combined with an error causing the filler image to peep up behind other photos, it produced a frightening effect:&lt;br&gt;

   <title>Cat GIFs & Mrkgnao: Ulysses, Reddit, and What Digital Editions Can Learn from Online Communities</title>
   <link href="/2013/07/29/redditulysses"/>
   <updated>2013-07-29T08:00:21-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/07/29/redditulysses</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; participatory edition, I’m building a digital edition interface that allows site visitors to create and interact with a potentially high number of annotations and interpretations of Joyce&#39;s novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/25/iufeatures&quot;&gt;features of my site&lt;/a&gt; draw on existing exemplars of community content submission and discussion--particularly Reddit and StackExchange, two thriving hubs of people interacting with digital text. Readers on these sites are interacting with different content than a literary edition, for the most part; the success of the mechanisms supporting those interactions is fairly text-agnostic, however, relying more on an understanding of how people interact online than what content they&#39;re interacting with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of author James Joyce in the style of the Scumbag Steve meme&quot; src=&quot;/assets/joycememe.png&quot; width=&quot;219&quot; height=&quot;268&quot;&gt; Reddit isn&#39;t all memes, but here: Hey, this book isn&#39;t that difficul--oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StackExchange is a group of Q&amp;A sites that match experts up with questions in a specific field of knowledge--originally computing questions, but now a diverse range of specialties including Drupal, cooking, and English language usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve &lt;a title=&quot;Memes and Meaning: Reddit for Digital Humanists&quot; href=&quot;/2013/07/29/redditulysses&quot;&gt;blogged about academically useful corners of Reddit&lt;/a&gt; previously; I&#39;ll add another fascinating subreddit to the list for anyone seeking quality content on the site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit&quot; &gt;Theory of Reddit&lt;/a&gt; (r/theoryofreddit), a space for assessing how the entire community is functioning, whether that&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/related/z16g9/if_its_wrong_to_downvote_because_you_disagree_is&quot;&gt;discussing how upvoting&lt;/a&gt; is meant to work (upvote content that is a positive addition to the site, downvote things that you don&#39;t want to see as part of the community thoughtspace) and how upvoting actually works (people upvote things they agree with, downvote things they disagree with),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/l8id4/did_digg_make_us_the_dumb_how_have_reddit&quot; &gt;graphing changes&lt;/a&gt; in the Flesch-Kincaid reading level of comments over time since the beginning of the site, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/17kliv/less_than_half_4848_of_reddits_most_popular_links&quot; &gt;troubleshooting underprovision&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;when too many people rely on others to contribute without doing so themselves&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theory of Reddit is a moderated/curated subreddit that defines itself as &quot;a mildly navel-gazing space for inquiring into what makes Reddit communities work and what we in a community can do to help make it better&quot;--in other words, an online community talking about being an online community, with the best discussion promoted to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the abstract use of such online community meta-cognition for participatory digital edition developers, Theory of Reddit and StackExchange have been useful in planning some specific features for Infinite Ulysses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. A tool becomes how its community uses it. &lt;/strong&gt;At least partially, the usage of an online community develops organically: another fine reason for user testing and a readiness to adapt as the user community grows and changes over time. I&#39;m fascinated with Reddit&#39;s unintentional awarding of high-visibility platforms to people who provide highly upvoted content. Users are able to edit posts after posting them; posts that make the front page (i.e. get enough upvotes to be seen by a huge number of site visitors) will usually get a small addendum on the text of the post to the effect of &quot;wow, I made the front page&quot;--but there&#39;s the potential (sometimes embraced) to use that editing power to expose a large number of readers to your thoughts on any subject (e.g. political activism). I like that providers of &quot;good&quot; content (for some meaning of good) are rewarded with more viewers; I also like the reminder that people will use a site the way that makes sense to them, oftentimes the way that is most convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I initially anticipated Infinite Ulysses as a place where people would add contextual annotations to the novel, I quickly realized that many readers would use the annotation field to ask questions or simply mark things they don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s probably going to happen; I can&#39;t prevent it, and I wouldn&#39;t want to stop it. To build toward that realistic site usage--acknowledging that to read a difficult book is to have questions as well as answers!--I&#39;ll borrow a feature from the StackExchange sites, which provide a list of unanswered questions on the site (which you can also pull into your RSS feed). This way, Joyce junkies with a few spare minutes over lunch can pull up a question or two to answer, and I can identify points in the text in need of thicker annotation. I&#39;ll also be able to remove the questions/notes marking non-comprehension so that they don&#39;t clog the view of annotations with content, but I think it would also be useful and encouraging to first-time readers to leave some sort of simple sign behind to show that others struggled with the same point in the novel (perhaps a small icon, or a filter you can turn on to see highlighted text where questions were raised).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Choosing what to show near the top of a list of comments/annotation/tags isn&#39;t as easy as it seems. &lt;/strong&gt;Reddit suffers from a problem of the quickest comments on a post often getting the most upvotes, while later good comments get lost far down the page because readers don&#39;t read far enough to assess them. Kaj Magnus Lindberg has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debiki.com/-9qb49-solving-problem-first-comment-gets-all-upvotes#.UU8bHVtabV4&quot; &gt;a great post on this problem&lt;/a&gt;, where he advocates sorting not by upvotes only, but by upvotes divided by some measure of how much attention a post has received (views or time since the comment was posted). A similar issue crops up with the question of tagging annotations to allow filtering and toggling: do I define a limited vocabulary that readers can use, or allow users to create new tags? If I choose the latter, how do I deal with similar tags, misspellings, and variants? Even if I put an auto-complete option on the tagging field, the number of possible tags might become so staggering that most tags see little use, and different tagging words are created to basically tag the same thing. With both the questions of sorting comments (i.e. annotations) and wrangling tags, I&#39;ll be reading up on how other online communities have handled the problems, and I also expect to make changes to the site after I see how real users interact with these options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Reputation is established by your activity on the site.&lt;/strong&gt; To reduce the load of work on moderators, StackExchange has tiered ranges of &quot;reputation&quot; points awarded for different activities on the site; new users start with a reduced number of capabilities that expand the more they contribute. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation&quot;&gt;This 2009 post&lt;/a&gt; on how StackExchange handles moderation emphasizes that abilities and &quot;rep&quot; are gained through active participation and providing content that others deem useful: &quot;Reputation is a (very) rough measurement of how much the Stack Overflow community trusts you. Reputation is never given, it is earned by convincing other Stack Overflow users that you know what you’re talking about.&quot; With this tiered system plus giving users the ability to flag problematic content for moderator consideration, users are both able to establish credibility and reduce the load of human moderation work. I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d use a similar system on Infinite Ulysses; I want to attract a diverse array of Joycean experience to the site, but I worry about creating any bar to participation or hierarchy of who&#39;s most valuable to the site. At the same time, I know that some reward for frequent contributions (a weekly top contributers? top question-answerers?) at least makes me more excited about contributing regularly to such a site. I&#39;ll definitely at least keep private tabs on frequent contributors and try to highlight their work, perhaps by posting curated sets of their annotations on the front of the site on some rotational basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month, I shifted gears from installation and configuration of my local Infinite Ulysses site to the first new coding work on the project (&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; site is part of that project.&lt;/em&gt;). I&#39;ve captured a brief tech review of the existing tools and projects that are helping me through example or incorporation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modernist Commons: Digital Editing in a Box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinite Ulysses is being built off the in-development &lt;a href=&quot;http://modernistcommons.ca&quot; &gt;Modernist Commons&lt;/a&gt; (MC) digital editing platform, an initiative of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://editingmodernism.ca&quot; &gt;Editing Modernism in Canada&lt;/a&gt; (EMiC) research group, of which I&#39;m a doctoral fellow. MC includes the following platforms, toolkits, and digital standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://islandora.ca&quot;&gt;Islandora&lt;/a&gt;, a platform taking a best-practice approach to digital assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drupal.org&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; (a content management system that’s great at taxonomy); I’ll be using Drupal 7, as Islandora and MC developmenthave recently migrated to this version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fedora-commons.org&quot;&gt;Fedora Commons&lt;/a&gt; (digital object management: managing, preserving, and linking digital objects)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Solrsearch platform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;CWRC Writer: an in-development “in-browser text markup editor for use by collaborative scholarly editing projects”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cwrctc.artsrn.ualberta.ca&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promised features include: “close-to-WYSIWYG editing and enrichment of scholarly texts with meaningful visual representations of markup” and the  “ability to export using ‘weavers’ that recombine the plain text, the TEI, and the RDF into different forms (including a TEI-like embedded XML)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shared-canvas.org&quot;&gt;Shared Canvas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The SharedCanvas data model enables the construction of views by distributed collaborators, by annotating a shared &quot;Canvas&quot; resource which is then rendered using a presentation system... Many different images of a page may exist, along with a transcriptions, editions and translations of the text.” (from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shared-canvas.org&quot;&gt;Shared Canvas homepage&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;RDF (Resource Description Framework), a non-hierarchical metadata data model for describing relationships among things (e.g. x is part of y)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFYLu83WtX0&quot;&gt;A Seussian explanation of RDF&lt;/a&gt; by David Wood (YouTube video)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEI (the hierarchical Text Encoding Initiative standard)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital Discussion and Disputation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also be looking at the following tools and projects with features of possible interest in my participatory work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prism.scholarslab.org&quot;&gt;Prism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu&quot;&gt;Debates in the Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt; both allow readers to highlight sections of the text of interest, adding this work to a pool of data on what areas all readers have highlighted. Prism uses this to identify both consensus and differences in how readers define ideas such as “Modernism” and “Realism” in a text; &lt;em&gt;Debates&lt;/em&gt; provides statistics on what other readers are marking as interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of social commenting: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcpress.media-commons.org/plannedobsolescence&quot;&gt;Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s Planned Obsolescence&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guide.dhcuration.org&quot;&gt;DH Curation Guide&lt;/a&gt;, and the latest version of the online Debates in DH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teichi.org&quot;&gt;TEICHI&lt;/a&gt;: Drupal 6 + TEI encoding framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platforms for social annotation/commenting such as eComma, Public Poetics, Digress.It (or other Wordpress/Buddypress solutions), and CommentPress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Infinite Ulysses: Project Precedents and Caveats</title>
   <link href="/2013/06/27/infinite-ulysses-background"/>
   <updated>2013-06-27T07:30:46-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/06/27/infinite-ulysses-background</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick review of contextualizing and digital resources for &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; editioning, plus some notes on how I&#39;m imagining (and limiting my imagination of) the final &quot;Infinite &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&quot;&lt;/em&gt; digital edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contextualized Joyce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project builds on previous Joycean contextualizing work: on the print side, Blamire&#39;s &lt;em&gt;New Bloomsday Book&lt;/em&gt; and Gifford&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses An&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;notated&lt;/em&gt;, and online, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jjon.org&quot; &gt;James Joyce Online Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clemson.edu/cedp/tech%20colloquium%202001/groden%20files/hypermedia.html&quot; &gt;Michael Groden&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s notes and prototypes. Previous contextualizations (especially those on a higher, more macro-level of understanding the basics of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; rather than specific allusions) carry an increased risk of authorial bias because of their individual authorship (e.g. the &lt;em&gt;Bloomsday Book&lt;/em&gt; is very interested in charting Bloom&#39;s development as a Christ figure); while the sources I&#39;ve named here are all excellent and useful pieces of scholarship, I&#39;m very interested in seeing how a participatory edition apparatus moderates among a variety of higher-level contextual interpretations and whether we might thus prevent a canon of interpretation from calcifying around the text. &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is also an interesting contextualization problem in that there are many sets of contextualizations floating around the web from both scholars and amateurs (in the old and new senses of the word); I’m interested in bringing diverse sets of interpretation together in one place and seeing how they overlap or contend with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For digital projects that deal not only with annotation proper, but with how we can best display annotations for reading, check out Michael Groden&#39;s work (again), the &lt;a href=&quot;http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~ehrlich/jjtm/demo&quot;&gt;James Joyce Text Machine&lt;/a&gt;, or my 2008/2009 (dated) prototype &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com&quot; &gt;UlyssesUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt; (jump into reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://ulyssesulysses.com/episode1.shtml&quot; &gt;from here&lt;/a&gt;; the navigation is a bit misleading).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scholarly Precedents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key print precedents for this project are variorum and other editions that deal with a large quantity of variants, marginalia, or other annotation, such as the Shelley-Godwin manuscript notebooks and Hans Gabler’s synoptic &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;; these last two examples have convenient (though not-completely-realized) digital counterparts in Michael Groden’s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses in Hypermedia&lt;/em&gt; prototype and the developing &lt;a href=&quot;http://shelleygodwinarchive.org&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shelley-Godwin Archive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I will also build on my own research into handling multiple categories of annotation begun with the 2008-2009 &lt;em&gt;UlyssesUlysses&lt;/em&gt; prototype (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com&quot; &gt;UlyssesUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt;), which is a dated site in terms of my technical and design abilities, but shows some of my first thinking about how we deal with the experience of accessing contextual annotations while reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveats, questions, notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is an amazing text to test the possibilities of digital edition work, but for the quality of the site&#39;s main goals (and my desire to complete my dissertation in a reasonable amount of time), interesting and important edition features such as topic modeling the episodes, or giving more than a nod and an infrequent annotation to acknowledge the growth of the text into the form readers see in front of them (i.e. presenting a versioned text), aren&#39;t planned for this phase of the project. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ll be releasing this project&#39;s code (Drupal modules, themes) on GitHub so that anyone can reuse or modify my work in their own digital edition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m expecting the first phase of this digital edition to emphasize pedagogy as modeling knowledge: how do we pass through the text, how do we conceptually annotate what we&#39;re reading with some degree of &quot;certainty&quot;? I like to think that as we create annotations and visualizations and other features with the first-time reader in mind, we’re modeling and testing our scholarly knowledge: I’ll be able to do some analysis of data on how people read and annotate the text, explore the exploded &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, examine debates over interpretation occurring on the site, and think about best practices for interface design for the public humanities. This digital edition will best flourish with input from all levels of &lt;em&gt;Ulysse&lt;/em&gt;an experience, though; a public humanities discussion isn&#39;t at its richest if it&#39;s all public, no humanists. If you&#39;re familiar with Joyce, &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, Modernism, and/or scholarly editing and have any suggestions for how this site could develop into a tool that’s useful for scholars visiting it from the front-end (and not just for my own behind-the-scenes theorizing), please do let me know (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com/contact&quot;&gt;contact page&lt;/a&gt;). Or if you don’t have suggestions for this site because you don’t think you’d use it, tell me about how you like to access contextualizing information and what tools you wish existed for locating and working with it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can this site serve both first-time readers and scholars (people with different needs for the level of contextual annotation)? What about readers versus browsers versus searchers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions like the last one are what makes framing this as an experiment useful--not only do I not know the answer to these questions of scope yet, I won&#39;t know how the site breaks or elicits unintentional (organic) usage until I test it with real users. In a future post, I&#39;ll discuss some of the ways I&#39;ve anticipated real versus ideal use of the site, as well as some unanswered questions about the site&#39;s use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Experimental Editions: Digital Editions as Methodological Prototypes</title>
   <link href="/2013/06/26/experimental-editions"/>
   <updated>2013-06-26T07:30:58-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/06/26/experimental-editions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &quot;Infinite &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&quot; project falls more on the &quot;digital editions&quot; than the &quot;digital editing&quot; side of textual scholarship; these activities of coding, designing, and modeling how we interact with (read, teach, study) scholarly editions are usefully encompassed by Bethany Nowviskie&#39;s understanding of edition &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/bpn2f/1866/interface.html&quot; &gt;interfacing&quot;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textual scholarship has always intertwined theory and practice, and over the last century, it’s become more and more common for both theory and practice to be accepted as critical activities. Arguments about which document (or eclectic patchwork of documents) best represents the ideal of a text, for example, were practically realized through editions of specific texts. As part of this theory through practice, design experiments are also a traditional part of textual scholarship, as with the typographic and spatial innovations of scholarly editor &lt;a title=&quot;Recovering Teena Rochfort-Smith: Complex Edition Prototype, Female Victorian Editor&quot; href=&quot;/2012/11/12/recovering-teena-rochfort-smith-complex-edition-prototype-female-victorian-editor&quot; &gt;Teena Rochfort-Smith’s 1883 &lt;em&gt;Four-Text &#39;Hamlet&#39; in Parallel Columns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/rochfortsmithhamlet.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How did we get here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of McKerrow and the earlier twentieth-century New Bibliographers brought a focus to the book as an artifact that could be objectively described and situated in a history of materials and printing practices, which led to theorists such as McKenzie and McGann’s attention to the social life of the book—its publication and reception—as part of an edition’s purview. This cataloging and description eventually led to the bibliographic and especially iconic (visual, illustrative) elements of the book being set on the same level of interpretive resonance as a book’s linguistic content by scholars such as McGann, Tinkle, and Bornstein. Concurrently, Randall McLeod argued that the developing economic and technological feasibility of print facsimile editions placed a more unavoidable responsibility on editors to link their critical decisions to visual proof. Out of the bias of my web design background, my interest is in seeing not only the visual design of the texts we study, but the visual design of their meta-texts (editions) as critical—asking how the interfaces that impart our digital editing work can be as critically intertwined with that editing as Blake’s text and images were interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When is a digital object itself an argument?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Sample &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samplereality.com/2013/02/08/when-does-service-become-scholarship&quot;&gt;has asked&lt;/a&gt;, “When does anything—service, teaching, editing, mentoring, coding—become scholarship? My answer is simply this: a creative or intellectual act becomes scholarship when it is public and circulates in a community of peers that evaluates and builds upon it”. It isn’t whether something is written, or can be described linguistically, that determines whether critical thought went into it and scholarly utility comes out of it: it’s the appropriateness of the form to the argument, and the availability of that argument to discussion and evaluation in the scholarly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editions—these works of scholarly building centered around a specific literary text, which build into materiality theories about the nature of texts and authorship—these editions we’re most familiar with are not the only way textual scholars can theorize through making. Alan Galey’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/index.html&quot; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Visualizing Variation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; coding project is a strong example of non-edition critical building work from a textual scholar. The &lt;em&gt;Visualizing Variation&lt;/em&gt; code sets, whether on their own or applied to specific texts, are (among other things) a scholarly response to the early modern experience of reading, when spellings varied wildly and a reader was accustomed to holding multiple possible meanings for badly printed or ambiguously spelled words in her mind at the same time. By experimenting with digital means of approximating this historical experience, Galey moves theorists from discussing the fact that this different experience of texts occurred to responding to an actual participation in that experience. (The image below is a still from an example of his &quot;Animated Variants&quot; code, which cycles contended words such as sallied/solid/sullied so that the reader isn&#39;t biased toward one word choice by its placement in the main text.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/visualizingvariation.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galey’s experiments with animating textual variants, layering scans of marginalia from different copies of the same book into a single space, and other approaches embodied as code libraries are themselves critical arguments: “Just as an edition of a book can be a means of reifying a theory about how books should be edited, so can the creation of an experimental digital prototype be understood as conveying an argument about designing interfaces” (Galey, Alan and Stan Ruecker. “How a Prototype Argues.” Literary and Linguistic Computing 25.4 (2010): 405-424.). These arguments made by digital prototypes and other code and design work, importantly, are most often arguments about meta-textual-questions such as how we read and research, and how interfaces aid and shape our readings and interpretations; such arguments are actually performed by the digital object itself, while more text-centric arguments—for example, what Galey discovered about how the vagaries of early modern reading would have influenced the reception of, for example, a Middleton play—can also be made, but often need to be drawn out from the tool and written up in some form, rather than just assumed as obvious from the tool itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition</title>
   <link href="/2013/06/25/iufeatures"/>
   <updated>2013-06-25T07:30:49-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/06/25/iufeatures</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#39;s post introduced some of my research questions with the &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?&quot; href=&quot;/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro&quot;&gt;Infinite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&quot; project; here, I&#39;ll outline some specific features I&#39;ll be building into the digital edition to give it participatory capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project combines its speculative design approach with the scholarly primitive of curation (dealing with information abundance and quality and bias), imagining scholarly digital editions as popular sites of interpretation and conversation around a text. By drawing from examples of how people actually interact with text on the internet, such as on the social community &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com&quot; &gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and the Q&amp;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stackexchange.com&quot; &gt;StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; sites, I&#39;m creating a digital edition interface that allows site visitors to create and interact with a potentially high number of annotations and interpretations of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that readers on the beta-site aren&#39;t working from a blank slate, I&#39;ll seed the site with annotations that offer a few broadly useful tags that mark advanced vocabulary, foreign languages, and references to Joyce&#39;s autobiography so that the site&#39;s ways of dealing with annotations added by other readers can be explored. Readers can also fill out optional demographic details on their account profiles that will help other readers identify people with shared interests in or levels of experience with &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of a platform for adding annotations to edited texts, readers of the digital edition will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. tag the annotations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;For Stephen&#39;s description of Haines&#39; raving nightmare about a black panther, a reader might add the annotation &quot;&lt;em&gt;Haines&#39; dream foreshadows the arrival of main character Leopold Bloom in the story; Bloom, a Jewish Dubliner, social misfit, and outcast from his own home, is often described as a sort of &#39;dark horse&#39;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. This annotation can be augmented by its writer (or any subsequent reader) with tags such as &quot;JoyceAutobiography&quot; (for the allusions to Joyce&#39;s own experience in a similar tower), &quot;DarkHorses&quot; (to help track &quot;outsider&quot; imagery throughout the novel), and &quot;dreams&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. toggle/filter annotations both by tags and by user accounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Readers can either hide annotations they don&#39;t need to see (e.g. if you know Medieval Latin, hide all annotations translating it) or bring forward annotations dealing with areas of interest (e.g. if you&#39;re interested in Joyce and Catholicism)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Readers can hide annotations added by certain user accounts (perhaps you disagree with someone&#39;s interpretations, or only want to see annotations by other users that are also first-time readers of the book).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. assign weights to both other readers&#39; accounts and individual annotations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;As with Reddit, each annotation (once added to the text) can receive either one upvote or one downvote from each reader, by which the annotation&#39;s usefulness can be measured by the community, determining how often and high something appears in search results and browsing. Votes on annotations will also accrue to the reader account that authored those annotations, so that credibility of annotators can also be roughly assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. cycle through less-seen and lower-ranked editorial contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;To prevent certain annotations from never being read (a real issue unless every site visitor wishes to sit and rank every annotation!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. track of contentious annotations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;To identify and analyze material that receives an unusual amount of both up- and down-voting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. save private and public sets of annotations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Readers can curate specific sets of annotations from the entire pool of annotations, either for personal use or for public consumption. For example, a reader might curate a set of annotations that provide clues to &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&#39; mysteries, or track how religion is handled in the book, or represent the combined work of an undergraduate course where &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; was an assigned text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m expecting that the real usage of these features will not go as planned; online communities I&#39;m studying while building this edition all have certain organic popular usages not originally intended by the site creators, and I&#39;m excited to discover these while conducting user testing. I&#39;ll be discussing more caveats as to how these features will be realized, as well as precedents to dealing with heavy textual annotations, in a subsequent post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Wireframe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IUwireframe1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of documenting an involving project, here&#39;s a quick and blurry glance at my very first wireframe of the site&#39;s reading page layout (a higher-res, readable wireframe with a walkthrough should follow in the next few weeks). I thought of this as a &quot;kitchen sink wireframe&quot;; that is, the point was not to create the final look of the site or to section off correct dimensions for different features, but merely to &lt;em&gt;represent&lt;/em&gt; every feature I wanted to end up in the final design with some mark or symbol (e.g. up- and down-voting buttons). The plan for the final reading page is to have a central reading pane, a right sidebar where annotations can be authored and voted up or down, and a pull-out drawer to the left where readers can fiddle with various settings to customize their reading experience (readers also have the option of setting their default preferences for these features—e.g. that they never want to see annotations defining vocabulary—on their private profile pages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to finessing this layout with reader feedback toward a reading space that offers just the right balance of the annotations you want handy with a relatively quiet space in which to read the text. This project builds from the HCI research into screen layout I conducted during my master&#39;s, which produced an earlier &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; digital edition attempt of mine, the 2008/2009 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com&quot; &gt;UlyssesUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/ulyssesulysses1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
UlyssesUlysses does some interesting things in terms of customizing the learning experience (choose which category of annotation you want visibly highlighted!) and the reading experience (mouse over difficult words and phrases to see the annotation in the sidebar, instead of reading a text thick with highlightings and footnotes). On the downside of things, it uses the Project Gutenberg e-text of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, HTML/CSS (no TEI or PHP), and an unpleasant color scheme (orange and brown?). I&#39;ve learned much about web design, textual encoding, and &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; since that project, and it&#39;s exciting to be able to document these early steps toward a contextualized reading experience with the confidence that this next iteration will be an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possibilities?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because code modules already exist that allow many of these features within other contexts (e.g. upvoting), I will be able to concentrate my efforts on applying these features to editorial use and assessing user testing of this framework. I&#39;ll likely be building with the Modernist Commons editing framework, which will let me use both RDF and TEI to record relationships among contextualizing annotations; there’s an opportunity to filter and customize your reading experience along different trajectories of inquiry, for example by linking clues to the identity of Bloom’s female correspondent throughout the episodes. Once this initial set of features is in place, I’ll be able to move closer to the &lt;em&gt;Ulysses &lt;/em&gt;text while users are testing and breaking my site. One of the things I hope to do at this point is some behind-the-scenes TEI conceptual encoding of the Circe episode toward visualizations to help first-time readers of the text deal with shifts between reality and various reality-fueled unrealities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practical Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this project&#39;s speculative design (what if everyone wants to chip in their own annotations to &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;?), I&#39;m also building for the reality of a less intense, but still possibly wide usage by scholars, readers, teachers, and book clubs. This dissertation is very much about not just describing, but actually making tools that identify and respond to gaps I see in the field of digital textual studies, so part of this project will be testing it with various types of reader once it’s been built, and then making changes to what I’ve built to serve the unanticipated needs of these users (&lt;a title=&quot;DH Evaluation: A Four-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work&quot; href=&quot;/2012/10/31/3partdheval&quot; &gt;read more about user testing for DH here&lt;/a&gt;).  Tomorrow and Thursday, I&#39;ll be discussing precedents for the project&#39;s use of the edition as an experiment, as well as some caveats and unknowns I&#39;ll be facing as I continue this work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015.

&lt;p&gt;Digital humanities productions are increasingly sites of broader participation in textual interpretation, with how to evoke and harness &quot;meaningful&quot; crowdsourcing becoming an increasingly urgent question to scholars seeking a more public humanities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;First slide from my presentation on the Infinite Ulysses project.&quot; src=&quot;/assets/ulyssesfirstslide-300x165.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;165&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CC BY-NC Amanda Visconti)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a title=&quot;Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design &amp; the Urgency of the Public Humanities&quot; href=&quot;/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities&quot;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed how borrowing the HCI idea of &quot;participatory design&quot; can help DH practitioners and their public audiences to mutual intellectual gain. As we use the Web to open the texts we study to a wider community of discussion, bringing in diverse knowledges and interpretive biases, I’m interested in how we can usefully structure the overabundance of information proceeding from public contextual (Contextual annotation = notes that give a context for a word, phrase, or other chunk of text, ranging from definitions of advanced vocabulary to more interpretive annotations)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; annotation of literary texts. That is: my &quot;Infinite &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&quot; project is conceived as an idealistic speculative or thought experiment: what if we build an edition and everyone shows up and adds their annotations to the text? When this quantity of voices is combined with an unusually complex text such as James Joyce&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, how might we create a critical experience that adeptly handles not only issues of contextual annotation &lt;em&gt;quantity&lt;/em&gt; but also &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve previously blogged about the overarching plans for my digital dissertation: about how &lt;a title=&quot;My Digital Humanities Dissertation: Building Code, Design, and Games for Textual Knowledge and Participation&quot; href=&quot;/2013/04/09/dhdissintro&quot;&gt;I&#39;m empirically testing both current and personal theories about textuality through code and design&lt;/a&gt;, and how I&#39;m designing this building-as-scholarship &lt;a title=&quot;Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design &amp; the Urgency of the Public Humanities&quot; href=&quot;/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities&quot;&gt;towards helping everyone&lt;/a&gt;—textual scholars and the lay person—participate in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning. This post is about the first of my dissertation&#39;s three coding projects: designing and coding an interface that allows a participatory, vibrant, contextualizing conversation around complex Modernist texts, with &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; being my main focus. Packed into one sentence, my research question for this first project is: &lt;strong&gt;What might we learn from crafting an interface to usefully curate quantity and quality of contextual annotation for complex Modernist digital editions (such as &lt;em&gt;Ulysses),&lt;/em&gt; where the critical conversation is opened to the public?&lt;/strong&gt; That&#39;s a long sentence covering both more abstract and more concrete critical work, and I&#39;ll be breaking it into manageable chunks with the rest of this post and those to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Infinite” annotations.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there isn’t a complete digital edition of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; yet published, that hasn’t kept Joycean scholars from anticipating issues that might arise with the eventual migration to digital space. Where the limitations of print space have in the past kept annotations of the text in check, what will happen when a digital platform allows the addition and navigation of infinite annotations? Can we migrate complex print hypertexts such as&lt;em&gt; Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; to a digital space with socially multiplied annotations without, as Mark Marino wonders, &quot;diminish[ing] the force of the book&quot; (Mark C. Marino, &quot;Ulysses on Web 2.0: Towards a Hypermedia Parallax Engine&quot;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Assuming it were possible, would the creation of a system that automatically makes available all the allusions, unravels all the riddles, and translates foreign languages normalize Joyce&#39;s text? (Marino)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Joyce Effects: On Language, Theory, and History&lt;/em&gt;, Derek Attridge similarly sees a risk in &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&#39; hypertextualization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&#39;] cultural supremacy, and the scholarly efforts which reflect and promote that supremacy, have turned it into a text that confirms us in our satisfied certainties instead of one that startles and defies is and thus opens new avenues for thought and pleasure. It now reassures us of our place in what might otherwise seem a chaotic universe, or it provides a model of coherence to take a refuge in, a satisfying structure where the details all make sense… a spurious sense of rich complexity by reducing differences and distinctions (Derek Attridge, &lt;em&gt;Joyce Effects: On Language, Theory, and History&lt;/em&gt;, 185)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Attridge sees space for promise in the digital development of the text as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;The very magnitude of the encyclopedic Joycean hypertext can itself be unsettling… and it may be possible to produce a hypermedia version of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; that is anything but reassuring—one that revives, in new ways, the provocations and disturbances of the original publication... The best teachers (like the best critics) are those who find ways to sustain the disruptive force of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; even while they do their necessary work of explaining and demystifying (Derek Attridge, &lt;em&gt;Joyce Effects: On Language, Theory, and History&lt;/em&gt;, 186-188)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite there being no full digital edition of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; against which to test these fears and assumptions, we already have some questions about what happens to a complex Modernist text when “everyone shows up”, and I’m hoping that by creating a site that experiments with allowing “infinite” contextual annotation of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; (that’s where the “Infinite &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;” title of my project comes from), we can get a more realistic picture of what extreme annotation actually does to our experience of the text. When even &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; editor Hans Walter Gabler can still learn new things about &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; (Digital Ulysses Master Class with Hans Gabler, June 2013) , I&#39;m confident that Ulysses will persist as always partially unfixed, always giving back more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quantity and quality, signal and noise.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the final effect of unlimited space to discuss and interpret the text remains to be seen, the &quot;Infinite &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&quot; project will also tackle two more immediate problems: quality and quantity of annotation. If everyone’s submitting annotations to a digital edition, how can we automate the massive task of curation and moderation so that it occurs in a timely and unbiased manner? And once we’ve separated the wheat of critical yet diverse annotations from the chaff of repetitions, spam, and under-substantiated suggestions, how do we make the still-plentiful remaining material accessible to the users it would best serve? That is, how do we separate the signal from the noise when the “signal” of pertinent contextual annotations means different things for different reader needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So: what happens to a complex Modernist text when we allow &quot;infinite&quot; annotations on it, and how do we work with &quot;infinite&quot; annotations to filter, order, and display those annotations best suited to a given reader?&lt;/strong&gt; Tomorrow&#39;s post will explain the specific features I&#39;m coding into my interface to approach these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>O rocks, again: More Info Visualization of James Joyce's Ulysses (Bloomsday 2013 Project)</title>
   <link href="/2013/05/10/ulyssesinfoviz2013"/>
   <updated>2013-05-10T07:00:15-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/05/10/ulyssesinfoviz2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;THATCamp Prime 2012 happened to fall on Bloomsday last year, so a bunch of us—Ben Schmidt, Chad Rutkowski, Anastasia Salter, Heather Prescott, and me (Amanda Visconti)—jumpstarted a small infoviz project: a visualization of character interactions in James Joyce&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;. In keeping with the spirit of Molly Bloom, we said &lt;strong&gt;&quot;O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;--creating a way to see at a glance which characters are most social, who interacts with whom, and what type of interactions different characters have throughout the course of the Dublin day. We ended up producing &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis&quot;&gt;a basic visualization of character interactions in the &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wandering Rocks visualization&quot; src=&quot;/assets/wanderingrocks1-300x204.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this year&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday&quot;&gt;Bloomsday&lt;/a&gt; (Sunday, June 16th, 2013), I&#39;m gauging interest in helping expand our visualization to other pieces of the book: i&lt;del&gt;f I get enough responses (3? 4?),&lt;/del&gt; I&#39;ll write up an easy-to-follow tutorial and assign participants small sections of the book to cover (I&#39;m happy to let people indicate a section of interest, of course--but with a number of people working together, my assigning pieces will help us a) not do redundant work and b) produce data that covers complete sections of the novel instead of random pieces with large gaps in-between (and a visualization is more intuitive and useful if we can say &quot;this shows character interactions in chapter 1-4&quot; instead of &quot;character interactions on pages 22-37, 56-61, ....&quot;). I&#39;ll keep an updated list of unclaimed sections, too, in case anyone feels inspired to do extra work :) ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&#39;s involved? It&#39;s super easy&lt;/strong&gt;--&lt;em&gt;no knowledge&lt;/em&gt; of information visualization is required to participate, and although a basic familiarity with &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. having read the section you&#39;re working on once before) will make your work a bit faster because you can scan the pages for people interacting instead of read them, &lt;strong&gt;it&#39;s fine if you&#39;re reading Ulysses for the first time&lt;/strong&gt; (welcome to awesomeness--and I&#39;ll have something neat for you to check out in the fall! (One of my digital dissertation coding projects is building a participatory digital edition interface for Ulysses aimed at a helpful, customized reading experience for first-time readers of the novel. Tweet me @literature_geek to be added to the list of future beta-testers!) ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The work is super simple:&lt;/strong&gt; you&#39;ll fill in a spreadsheet each time two characters have some sort of interaction (i.e. every time two characters run into each other--not every sentence spoken in a dialogue), taking down the names of each pair of characters and the type of interaction they have (we&#39;ve got codes for seven somewhat arbitrary types of interaction, from 1 &quot;character is thinking of another character&quot; to 7 &quot;character having intimate contact with another character&quot;). I&#39;ll create a tutorial blog post and/or video before Bloomsday that walks you through what to do, and I&#39;ll drop everyone&#39;s work into an information visualization program to produce the visualization. As a gauge for the amount of information you&#39;ll be taking down, the &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; section--possibly the most interaction-intense section of the book except for &quot;Circe&quot;--had 43 interactions by our count. If you&#39;re just scanning the pages for character interactions instead of reading, you can spend as little as 10-20 minutes covering a section of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested (I might make awesome laptop stickers for participants...!)? Fill out the Google form below. There&#39;s a space to ask questions if you have any. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>"Electronic Literature after Flash": Weirding Credible Digital Platforms to Tell Stories</title>
   <link href="/2013/04/11/elitafterflash"/>
   <updated>2013-04-11T14:00:24-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/04/11/elitafterflash</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The slow death of Flash also leaves a host of [e-lit] authors who can no longer create in their chosen medium. It’s as if a novelist were told that she could no longer use a word processor—indeed, no longer even use words. Or is it?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m pleased to be part of Mark Sample&#39;s MLA &#39;14 roundtable proposal, &quot;Electronic Literature after Flash&quot;. You can &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/04/11/elitafterflash&quot; &gt;read the whole proposal&lt;/a&gt; over on Mark&#39;s blog (which, incidentally, has just a lot of great writing about DH and about teaching as scholarship)--I&#39;ll be joining a group of both e-lit scholars and authors: Mark, Leo Flores, Chris Funkhouser, Dene Grigar, Mark Marino, Stuart Moulthrop, and Zach Whalen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the chunk on my part of the roundtable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Visconti surveys the way e-lit can appropriate digital platforms that were never designed for poetics or narrative. Visconti argues that such platform poaching combines the veneer of credibility associated with a digital archive or a wiki with a narrative license that is simultaneously ethically dangerous and rich with possibilities for counterfactual knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to discuss the ethics and possibilities of e-lit’s distorting occupation of platforms intended for other uses—more specifically, to start a conversation about the mindful misuse of academic or similarly  “credible” platforms. E-lit built off social media frameworks (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urban3zero.com&quot;&gt;The Urban 30&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://laflood.citychaos.com&quot;&gt;LA Flood project&lt;/a&gt;), while not always immediately recognizable as fictional, at least carries with it our awareness of the biases and misinformation of news and gossip. Combining the veneer of credibility associated with a digital archive or wiki framework with narrative license is a tactic both ethically dangerous and rich with possibilities for ‘patacritical and counterfactual knowledges. I’ll briefly outline a few such e-lit appropriations and warpings of credible platforms, such as the speculative but factually grounded Anglish Moot constructed language wiki and the counterfactually half-true eduARG &lt;em&gt;The Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry&lt;/em&gt;’s historical wiki, as well as mention a few platforms ripe for creative misuse. This lightning talk should provoke discussion about the ethics of e-lit, weirding existing platforms, and the role of e-lit in communicating factual knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design & the Urgency of the Public Humanities</title>
   <link href="/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities"/>
   <updated>2013-04-11T05:33:44-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarly editor Gary Taylor has asked (And I have requoted just about every month) : “How can you love a work, if you don&#39;t know it? How can you know it, if you can&#39;t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” Scholarly editors are an integral part of the continuum that keeps the stories of the past available to and understood by the present—but just as important in Taylor’s formulation is the &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, that public of not just scholars, but also readers beyond the academy whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant. &lt;strong&gt;I intend to build tools and digital editions that help everyone—textual scholars and the lay person—participate in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning.&lt;/strong&gt; We need to rethink the structure—the look and behavior—of our most foundational form, the scholarly edition, looking to the full possibilities of the digital (and not just those that approximate traditional codex form) in order to see a more public textual studies—a textual studies that encourages participation outside of a limited circle of expertise, using games and ludic approaches, provocations to deeper thinking, visual design, and visual knowledge to share our intelligence about and passion for book studies more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As researchers, we feel the urgency of a more publicly understood and useful humanities: convincing the public of our worth ties into how we are funded, but even more importantly, our ability to argue convincingly for our worth to non-specialists requires us to have an understanding of our studies so clear that it can be rendered into simple language. Teaching is knowing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p  style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;[Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman] prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, &#39;Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.&#39; Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, &#39;I&#39;ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.&#39; But he came back a few days later to say, &#39;I couldn&#39;t do it. &lt;strong&gt;I couldn&#39;t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don&#39;t really understand it.&lt;/strong&gt;&#39; (David L. Goodstein, in &lt;em&gt;Feynman&#39;s Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human-computer interaction, a field focused on interfaces between user and computer (including interfaces of reading and research), provides a useful approach to a humanities that simultaneously benefits the public and scholars: participatory design.&lt;strong&gt; Participatory design&lt;/strong&gt; is an approach not just centered on the scholar or just on the public, but finessing the “third space” of discussion and shared learning that exists when the two groups come into conversation; results can include “challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal (many-voiced) dialogues across and through differences“ (Muller, Michael J. &quot;Participatory Design: The Third Space in HCI&quot;. In &lt;em&gt;The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook&lt;/em&gt;. 1051-1068.). When we bring the public into our scholarly conversations, everyone benefits; designing for interactive participation and pedagogy is a scholarly activity that also benefits the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my participatory design approach to digital edition interfaces, &lt;a title=&quot;Living Editions: What Seminars Can Teach Us About Building Digital Editions&quot; href=&quot;/2012/11/06/livingeditions&quot; &gt;I draw on my own positive experiences in graduate literary seminars, in the belief that we can build scholarly digital editions that model two of the most rewarding aspects of a good class&lt;/a&gt;: communal enjoyment and communal knowledge of a text. A well-run seminar gets participants excited about the subtleties of a text, regardless of how remote its language or voice or subject matter might be from their own lives; a well-run seminar also results in everyone, teacher as well as students, gaining new insight into a literary text. As I experiment with the nature of digital editions, textual materiality, and other scholarly questions, I believe I can at the same time imagine digital editions as ideal communal spaces of literary conversation where scholars and public can learn from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dissertation addresses a gap in humanities knowledge: the digital edition, like the print edition before it, is developing into a key form of scholarly textual presentation, yet the advances in the past thirty years of textual studies have mostly focused on three areas of study to the exclusion of other knowledge: the development of a standard for encoding text (the Text Encoding Initiative), the development of archives presenting well-encoded text and textual images alongside tools for searching and inspecting these (e.g. The William Blake Archive), and theorizing possibilities for textual studies in digital spaces without making major changes to digital editions in concert with these theories (e.g. Jerome McGann’s &lt;em&gt;Radiant Textuality: Literature after the World Wide Web&lt;/em&gt;). To fill out the first two areas of study, we need to study in real scholarly situations how that encoded text, and those powerful but now fairly standard tools, are actually used and how they might be improved; to capitalize on the third area of study, we need to build these theories into our digital editions such that their innovative arguments are obvious to new users and empirically testable via user studies. There are some very good reasons why user-awareness isn&#39;t more prevalent in DH and in digital editions in particular (e.g. funding and grant time constraints, lack of example metrics to build off), and I&#39;ll be addressing these as well as throwing in my bit of DH user studies work for the next practitioner to build on. I&#39;ll also be discussing some recent and important work innovating the interfaces of our digital editions, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.tapasproject.org&quot;&gt;the TAPAS project&lt;/a&gt; (trying to open all that lovingly encoded text to remix and reuse for research and teaching), &lt;a href=&quot;http://inke.ca/projects/tools-and-prototypes&quot;&gt;various INKE initiatives&lt;/a&gt; (especially Jon Saklofske&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://inke.acadiau.ca/newradial&quot;&gt;NewRadial&lt;/a&gt; work imagining new entries into the Blake Archive), and Alan Galey&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/index.html&quot; &gt;Visualizing Variation&lt;/a&gt; code sets, all of which incorporate a laudable awareness of the broad end use and reading experience of editions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>My Digital Humanities Dissertation: Building Code, Design, and Games for Textual Knowledge and Participation</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do scholars interface with digital editions of literature, and how can we improve the appearance and behavior of digital edition interfaces to not only better support current scholarly use, but predict and create new ways of reading, teaching, and learning about texts? With my literature doctoral dissertation, titled &lt;em&gt;“How Can You Love a Text, If You Don’t Know It?”&lt;/em&gt; (As you might know if you read this blog, just my favorite pro-editing quotation: &quot;How can you love a work, if you don&#39;t know it? How can you know it, if you can&#39;t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?&quot; - Gary Taylor, &quot;The Renaissance and the End of Editing&quot;, in Palimpsest: Textual Theory and the Humanities, ed. George Bornstein and Ralph G. Williams (1993), 121-50.) &lt;em&gt;: Critical Code and Design toward Participatory Digital Editions&lt;/em&gt;, I&#39;m coding and designing scholarly tools, interfaces, and games that value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;building-as-making&lt;/strong&gt;: instead of the traditional monograph, employ and extend theory in the form of tools that can actually empirically test that theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;speculative design&lt;/strong&gt;: push our scholarly tools further by creating solutions for the future (e.g. a digital edition that attracts thousands of public participants)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;user-testing, participatory design, and the public humanities&lt;/strong&gt;: in the beliefs that teaching is knowing and it makes for a better world to share knowledge, build on &lt;a href=&quot;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380&quot; &gt;my master&#39;s thesis user study of public use of scholarly digital archives&lt;/a&gt; to create digital humanities tools that are useful to both scholars and lay-persons; we need to do a better job sharing our passion for the intricacies of our cultural heritage and present with the public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;games and play&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot;Games are unnecessary obstacles that we choose to tackle&quot;, says games researcher Jane McGonigal--and so are difficult texts; think about games as models of critical learning behavior; build our rich history of literary play and gaming into our digital edition toolkit, thinking about &lt;em&gt;Ivanhoe&lt;/em&gt;, the Oulipo, design fiction, communal storytelling, textual intervention, narrative alternate reality games, and video-game modding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;graphesis and the whole book&lt;/strong&gt;: grant the same acknowledgement of knowledge-containing visuals we do to our literary objects of study (e.g. Blake&#39;s image-texts) to their meta-texts (editions) by incorporating critical graphic design; dream big about conveying the whole book to remote researchers, not just linguistic content and 2D images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;modeling reading and editing practices&lt;/strong&gt;: if scholarly interpretation is a conversation, then model our digital editions on participatory exemplars of reading like online communities (e.g. Reddit) and the best graduate seminar experiences; teach people &quot;how to think like an editor&quot; to discover how editors&#39; own theories develop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;leveraging something old on something new&lt;/strong&gt;: by migrating and extending a prescient Victorian edition prototype and its design values to digital space, explore the affordances, limits, and possibilities of both the print and digital pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital editions are texts presented according to some critical ideal in digital space. We need to know more about how this scholarly form is used so that we can build sites that fully communicate and preserve literary texts, from the written word on the page to the iconic codes and materiality of the whole book, and so that we can in turn use digital editions as better platforms for inquiry into the nature of complex textual objects. &lt;strong&gt;I propose to build textual forms to understand them&lt;/strong&gt;, creating three digital edition interfaces that separately explore the textual behaviors of reading, teaching, and research. One project will explore the social experience of critical &lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt;, exploring whether a difficult Modernist text (&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;) becomes “normalized” or “diminished” by moving to the center of a public annotation, interpretation, and conversation, and how we might curate the information overload of a vibrantly active digital edition reader/commentator base. Another project treats &lt;strong&gt;teaching&lt;/strong&gt; as knowing, using a gamic digital framework for the teaching of editing as a tool for tracing the development of textual scholarship theory and opinion. A third project assesses the whole use a scholar in a physical archive might make of a codex and imagines how we might use digital affordances, such as linkable metadata and 3D models, to bring a less partial simulation of the whole book to remote &lt;strong&gt;research&lt;/strong&gt;ers. All three of these interface projects will be built around specific exemplar texts that push the boundaries of modeling via digital edition, texts that challenge both scholar and reader with a multiplicity of meanings (e.g. James Joyce’s notoriously multilayered &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;) or that manifestly cannot be fully communicated by current digital edition formats (e.g. the rich design of a &lt;a title=&quot;Recovering Teena Rochfort-Smith: Complex Edition Prototype, Female Victorian Editor&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/12/recovering-teena-rochfort-smith-complex-edition-prototype-female-victorian-editor&quot;&gt;presciently-hypertextual Victorian edition of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). By building digital edition interfaces that employ and extend current textual theory, this dissertation will advance our understanding of how a key scholarly form creates knowledge around texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;Studying our meta-texts by building.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textual studies concerns itself with the study of the history, forms, and whole content (from the linguistic to the material) of texts; digital textual scholarship, as a narrower discipline, focuses specifically on the preparation of such texts for scholarly use via a digital space. To push the current research, reading, and teaching abilities of the digital edition further, we need to not just theorize on paper what needs to be changed about editions—it is necessary that we make these theorized changes to digital editions through web design and code work, then critically assess what our interventions teach us about the texts of these digital editions, the form of digital editions in general, and about literary research and teaching in digital spaces. This dissertation proposes to take a step back from the specific literary texts prepared by textual scholars—and a step forward from the purely-written theorizing of other textual studies researchers—to create tools that explore the critical efficacy and possibilities of that increasingly quintessential meta-textual form, the digital edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 &gt;Three coding projects as scholarly experiments.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake textual scholar Morris Eaves conceives of editions not just as vessels for textual content, but as “problem-solving mechanisms”; within my broader exploration of the future of digital edition interfaces, I will focus on several specific problems in the form of three digital coding projects, best expressed by my tweets from earlier today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Digital editions= a key humanities scholarly form.

   <title>Monograph Writing Isn't the Only Scholarly Act: Chronicle Interview on Digital Dissertations</title>
   <link href="/2013/02/11/monograph-writing-aint-the-only-scholarly-act-chronicle-interview-on-digital-dissertations/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-11T14:31:28-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/02/11/monograph-writing-aint-the-only-scholarly-act-chronicle-interview-on-digital-dissertations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was interviewed about my digital humanities/digital dissertation work by Stacey Patton at &lt;em&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://chronicle.com/article/The-Dissertation-Can-No-Longer/137215&quot;&gt;here&#39;s a link&lt;/a&gt; and some snippets on my work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amanda Visconti, a doctoral student in her third year at the University of Maryland at College Park, entered the graduate program in English with a background in Web development, information studies, and user testing. She hasn&#39;t yet started on her dissertation—which will be digital—but has experimented with a prototype &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com&quot; &gt;digital edition of Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to read the novel&#39;s first two episodes with explanatory annotations and images that appear when the reader moves his or her mouse over words that might be confusing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Digital editions do a lot of things, but I&#39;m interested in making them more participatory, meaning that readers get an interactive, engaged experience instead of a passive reading experience,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Ms. Visconti says. &quot;Producing a traditional, book-style dissertation wouldn&#39;t help me do the scholarly work I need to do. &lt;strong&gt;And it wouldn&#39;t present that work to others in a way they could test, use, and benefit from.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ms. Visconti, the Maryland student, says she has had to defend her decision to do a nontraditional dissertation to academics who don&#39;t seem to think that digital projects on their own are scholarly enough. Some people assume, she says, that projects like hers are just Web sites where scholarship get published electronically; those professors [i.e. people--I didn&#39;t mean to call out professors] don&#39;t seem to understand how digital work can produce new tools for analysis that allow researchers to ask new questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;There is the lingering opinion that writing monographs is the only scholarly act,&quot; she says. &quot;Other activities, such as coding, designing, scholarly editing, and experimentation, are [too often treated as] pre- or postcritical [instead of as scholarly activities].&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Digital= 1 of many equally valid options for dissertations; that said, not a bad idea for any diss to argue rightness of its chosen platform&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amanda Visconti (@Literature_Geek) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/301032283551457281&quot;&gt;February 11, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Another article clarification: I&amp;#39;ve met surprisingly little resistance to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/digdiss?src=hash&quot;&gt;#digdiss&lt;/a&gt;; more curiosity &amp;amp; willingness to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amanda Visconti (@Literature_Geek) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/301034906560106496&quot;&gt;February 11, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Info Dump: Humanities Ph.D. Exams Advice</title>
   <link href="/2012/11/27/info-dump-humanities-doctoral-candidacy-exams-advice/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-27T08:00:48-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/11/27/info-dump-humanities-doctoral-candidacy-exams-advice</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I took my candidacy exams for the Ph.D. in English at the end of September. The exam itself was fun and immensely validating (especially as someone coming to the Ph.D. with a non-literature master’s degree), and &lt;strong&gt;the experience of preparing for the exam is one of the great overlooked reasons for getting a doctorate&lt;/strong&gt;. You&#39;ll never have this much time to devote just to reading, reading, reading—or if you do (well-funded sabbatical?), sticking to a reading schedule and forcing yourself to develop extensive declarative knowledge to this extent require a truly iron resolve and a high-stakes final platform for proving yourself. (Okay, that sounds an awful lot like writing a book or any other major research project. But rarely will you be this free from other obligations and this strong an impetus to succeed—I’m holding by the idea that preparing for the candidacy exam is a special time.) Managing exams is a great way to figure out how you do your best research—a trial run for the dissertation. And even the stress of exams is good: it will force you to make declarative and nuanced ideas you’ve been flirting with for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/ExamsSharingCopy.pdf&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s my reading list (covering works on and from the digital humanities and textual scholarship) and rationale for what&#39;s on the list&lt;/a&gt;. And here&#39;s a list of everything that helped me before and during my exam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pile of index cards used in studying for my exams&quot; src=&quot;/assets/indexstack-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot;&gt;The epic stack of index cards I used to force my knowledge to be declarative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.4158615695098503&quot;&gt;
&lt;li &gt;Each department differs, so &lt;strong&gt;know what exam format to prepare for early in the exams reading process&lt;/strong&gt;. What is the required length of the presentation (if any)? Can you bring slides and brief notes? Ask a fellow student or your advisor to give you a few mock exams questions early in your readings so you know how you should be reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask your committee to sign off on your reading list early in the process so that you can create and hold to a reading schedule&lt;/strong&gt;. I knew I would have a week before the exam to develop a presentation on a question prepared by my committee, so I made sure my reading was done before that week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to schedule time after your reading is finished to process everything.&lt;/strong&gt; I used two weeks to brainstorm a list of every question I felt I should be able to answer eloquently: drafted them on a whiteboard, then put them on index cards that I could flip through whenever I had a few spare minutes. In retrospect, this overprepared me for the exam, but I&#39;d do it again—it prepared me just the right amount for what comes after the exam (you can&#39;t know too much about your area of study, right? or about the types of questions you should be asking and have an opinion on?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure out where and how you’ll get your reading done.&lt;/strong&gt; Earplugs plus getting on the campus bus going the wrong way from work gave me a solid fifty minutes, twice a day, in which I couldn’t do anything but read or go through my stack of index cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;While you&#39;re anticipating questions, &lt;strong&gt;start thinking about where you want to take the experience.&lt;/strong&gt; What are the major questions you want to talk about, and how will you steer conversation that way? How will the backgrounds of your committee members direct those discussions? You can probably start to outline points your presentation will cover even before you get your presentation question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;Take paper notes during reading if that&#39;s useful to you, but &lt;strong&gt;schedule yourself to digitize these regularly&lt;/strong&gt; (don&#39;t let them pile up...). Most of your readings will influence your dissertation, and you&#39;ll thank yourself when you&#39;re able to do a keyword search for some great phrase you half recall—or export a citation list quickly—instead of hunting through a stack of papers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;Don&#39;t just digitize your notes: &lt;strong&gt;put them into citation management software as you create them&lt;/strong&gt;. I use&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zotero.org&quot;&gt; Zotero&lt;/a&gt;, which is free and syncs to Zotero&#39;s servers; there&#39;s the option to share your citations (and also your notes on these) if you&#39;re willing, but you can also keep things private. If you use the Zotero browser plugin, you can take snapshots of articles you&#39;re viewing online and link these to your citation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your exams room&lt;/strong&gt;. Will you have a podium to stand behind? Do you have the correct dongle to connect your computer to the projector? Also think about the layout of the room and what makes you comfortable, since you&#39;ll have time to rearrange tables and chairs before your committee arrives—choose whether a more formal or conversational layout makes you most comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;If you&#39;re like most people and have some public speaking anxiety, &lt;strong&gt;know how you&#39;re going to deal with that stress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li &gt;Don’t think about the exam as a quiz or trial—you’re being asked to talk about what you know and how various issues relate to things you care about. You can practice a standard answer format if that helps you out (your answer, three examples from the reading list that connect/critique/juxtapose, and address possible quibbles with your argument), but you probably won’t consciously rely on this structure—your exam should (one hopes) turn more into a conversation than a test. &lt;strong&gt;You could think of exams as a way of making well-structured responses automatic. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;Starting off with a well-practiced presentation will help you feel in control and relaxed enough to enjoy the rest of the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;You should know your research areas well by now, and everyone in the room is just looking for ways to let you show that expertise. You’ll rarely get this many smart people in a room to spend hours talking about your interests, so enjoy it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;One more practical thing: plan on getting to campus early—you don&#39;t want to worry about traffic or missing the bus the day of your exam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;Things to bring to your exam&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li &gt;a paper copy of your exams reading list for consultation during Q&amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;a watch (to know how much time you have)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;a flash drive with copy of presentation slides and notes (my laptop experienced surprise death 48 hours after my presentation; be prepared to use someone else&#39;s computer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;a water cup (not bottle, which is more difficult to drink from when standing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;a couple pens and &lt;strong&gt;a lot of blank paper&lt;/strong&gt; (ideally, a spiral; I used about ten sheets during the Q&amp;A to jot down bullet points for my response as the questions were being asked)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li &gt;the location of the room where you&#39;ll be presenting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Textual scholar Alan Galey discussed a fascinating &quot;early new media edition&quot; prototype at the 2012 Society for Textual Scholarship conference, and Matt Schneider followed up by sending me an article by Ann Thompson on the story behind this edition. The &lt;em&gt;Four-Text &#39;Hamlet&#39; in Parallel Columns&lt;/em&gt; prototype, created by the very young nineteenth-century editor Teena Rochfort-Smith, was intended to provide diplomatic transcriptions of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&#39;&lt;/em&gt;s first and second quartos (Q1, Q2), first folio (F1), plus Rochfort-Smith&#39;s own old-spelling edition based on Q2 but also pulling from F1 (Murphy, Andrew. &quot;Electric Shakespeares, The Arden Shakespeare CD ROM&quot;. Computers and the Humanities 32.5 (1998): 411-420.  /  Thompson, Ann. &quot;Teena Rochfort Smith, Frederick Furnivall, and the New Shakspere Society&#39;s Four-Text Edition of Hamlet&quot;. Shakespeare Quarterly 49.2 (Summer 1998): 125-139. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2902297&quot;&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2902297&lt;/a&gt;.). Textual scholar Thompson writes of this prototype that &lt;strong&gt;&quot;the sample demonstrates that, once completed, Teena Rochfort Smith&#39;s edition would have been the most complex presentation of the texts of Hamlet ever attempted&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The texts are printed in four columns across each pair of the book&#39;s landscape-oriented open pages, two columns per page. The edition employed six varieties of typeface, four inks, three kinds of underlining, and daggers, asterisks, and other symbols call out variants and the extent of variance. The prototype would have been nearly impossible to set and print given contemporary technology, and in fact Rochfort-Smith had agreed after her prototype&#39;s initial circulation among Society members to work toward a simpler final version of the edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the prescience of Rochfort-Smith&#39;s vision and her tragic, early death, it really bugged me that the only mention of her on Wikipedia was as a &quot;secretary&quot; (incorrect) for which male editor Frederick James Furnivall had left his wife and young son. So, I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teena_Rochfort-Smith&quot; &gt;my first from-scratch Wikipedia article on Rochfort-Smith&lt;/a&gt;; please edit if you know more!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Living Editions: What Seminars Can Teach Us About Building Digital Editions</title>
   <link href="/2012/11/06/livingeditions"/>
   <updated>2012-11-06T08:00:05-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/11/06/livingeditions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;In the humanities, what we produce is narrative, and that narrative comes out of experiences of reading.&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; &lt;em&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joguldi.com&quot; &gt;Jo Guldi&lt;/a&gt;, spoken comment at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/topicmodeling&quot;&gt;Topic Modeling Workshop&lt;/a&gt; at MITH on November 3, 2012&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My private shorthand for what I want to do with digital editions is &quot;make them like a seminar&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s not the only or best way of thinking about digital editions; for a start, editions are also conceptualized as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vessels for the centuries-old work of interpreting documents and what they say about the larger text they participate in,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pedagogy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cultural preservation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the remixing of multiply useful documents to create new texts for research and reading,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;useful substitutes for artifacts you can&#39;t physically access (Tanselle, G. Thomas. &lt;em&gt;A Rationale of Textual Criticism&lt;/em&gt;.), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a way of reading (McGann, Jerome. &quot;Ulysses as Postmodern Text: The Gabler Edition&quot;.&lt;em&gt; Criticism&lt;/em&gt; 27.3: 1985. 283-305.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to use the phrase &quot;digital editions&quot; instead of &quot;digital editing&quot; to emphasize that I&#39;m talking about a broader DH activity than traditional or text-level editing. These are choices of project and web design that inflect the form of the edition as a text in its own right, an interpretive, critical activity sometimes called &quot;interfacing&quot;. &quot;Digital edition&quot; as meta-text to &quot;editing&quot;&#39;s text, if you will. As my work is focused on our interfacing and behavior with the form of the edition (values that take concrete form with code such as CSS and PHP), I naturally gravitate toward a metaphor foregrounding the edition as a tool of &lt;strong&gt;communication&lt;/strong&gt; of interpretive knowledge and connected skills, one that aspires to &lt;strong&gt;a wider audience of users&lt;/strong&gt; than the traditional humanist monograph. That &quot;wider audience of users&quot; means that some of the approaches I&#39;ll discuss will be less aimed at seasoned scholars of a text than new readers–but many of these approaches can help provoke new knowledge for readers at any level of intimacy with a text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: if a digital edition can be like a seminar, what do I mean by &quot;seminar&quot;? I&#39;m usually thinking about graduate seminars as these have been my best in-class experiences, but we might apply lessons from any class-like meeting where a high percentage of the learners are self-motivated and ready to contribute new learning to the class, but benefit from the content, structure, and guidance provided by the instructor. Seminar as the give-and-take opposite to lecturing&#39;s delivery and reception of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a digital edition, the parallel is between the edition&#39;s team of creators (editors, designers, project developers) and its audience. There&#39;s been good discussion of developing more meaningful crowd-sourcing for editions over the past few years (e.g. the Scholars&#39; Lab&#39;s Praxis Program and their &lt;a href=&quot;http://prism.scholarslab.org/pages/about&quot; &gt;Prism tool&lt;/a&gt;, which harnesses &quot;collective interpretive energy&quot;), a movement away from treating our audience as students in a lecture (who mainly receive our polished work) or as free labor (for tasks that may be interesting but that require rote transcription rather than interpretive thinking and input of new ideas). The seminar metaphor understands that one party (the instructor/editors) has a privileged position to the project and its main content areas, but that their role is not only to impart information but scaffold and accept new knowledge and intellectual contributions from the other party (the students/edition users).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last seminar before achieving candidacy was was Dr. Neil Fraistat&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/category/spring-2012&quot;&gt;Technoromanticism&lt;/a&gt; (You can read my &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/author/amanda-visconti&quot;&gt;series of posts about the class&lt;/a&gt; or just my post about one of the times I group-taught the class &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/elit&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.), a class that I now realize was a living edition of Mary Shelley&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, and that used many approaches I&#39;d like to see in digital editions. By &lt;strong&gt;living edition&lt;/strong&gt;, I want to point at not just the excellently planned &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/syllabus&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt;, which structured our developing conversations about whole and hacked technologies of memory and imagination, monstrosity and virtual realities, always building on previous readings and conversations–but also the class itself, students and teacher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Five Approaches from the Technoro Seminar That Digital Editions Could Employ More Regularly:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1a. Seminar Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Technoro quickly had the seminar participants coming to class reporting sightings of our Romantic texts still breathing in the real world, whether that meant the image of Frankenstein&#39;s monster in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/the-colonial-subject-as-frankenstein&quot;&gt;colonial attitudes toward the Irish&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/bioshock-and-frankenstein-another-modern-prometheus&quot;&gt;Nigel Lepianka&#39;s connection&lt;/a&gt; of the videogame &lt;em&gt;Bioshock&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s &quot;Modern Prometheus&quot; motif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1b. Edition Take-away:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Explore not just your key content, but the boundaries of each text&#39;s discourse field. A digital edition that pulls in examples of the text&#39;s reception history provides the user with ways to trace themselves back to the world of its writing as well as gauge the ways a text still influences today&#39;s world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2a. Seminar Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The Technoro class brought in many voices with diverse practical and theoretical relationships to course motifs such as hacking and prosthetics of memory; in addition to the core of literature Ph.D. and M.A. students, students&#39; academic positionings included theater, creative writing, education, cognitive science, and circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2b. Edition Take-away:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;I&#39;d like to see digital editions do a better job incorporating the diverse voices and knowledges of their users. We need better ways of moderating, categorizing, and retrieving annotations from users with many different backgrounds; one decided area of my dissertation is a plan to address this issue via coding and design work, a project currently codenamed &quot;Infinite Ulysses&quot; (More on my dissertation plans soon!). And while we&#39;re talking about diversity, let&#39;s not forget to try designing our digital editions to be universally accessible (e.g. to screen readers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3a. Seminar Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/04/19/how-can-you-love-a-work-if-you-dont-know-it-six-lessons-from-team-markup&quot; &gt;my Technoro group project&lt;/a&gt;, I got to lead a group of students through learning and applying technical skills (Github for markup workflow, TEI encoding) that helped us think about the materiality and transmission history of our key text, &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, while learning to think like editors about page-level textual issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3b. Edition Take-away:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Don&#39;t obscure the digital structures of your meta-text (the edition framework) by only paying attention to the materiality of the text your edition surrounds. Document decisions about project development and editing methodology using accessible language, and don&#39;t efface the human realities behind this work; record both failures and triumphs. If on top of that your edition is able to teach something of how to &quot;think like an editor&quot; to its users, well... that&#39;s for another post, as it&#39;s a goal of one of the tools I&#39;m building for my dissertation. (I&#39;ve seen a few examples of editions trying out this possibility, such as the defunct playspace for rearranging Emily Dickinson&#39;s poems that used to be a part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emilydickinson.org&quot; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Dickinson Electronic Archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4a. Seminar Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;One of Technoro&#39;s course requirements was for each participant to team-teach two class meetings. Students quickly expanded on fairly standard teaching approaches like preparing short lectures and bringing questions to class, to approaches that generated more new ideas such as thought and design experiments (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/elit&quot;&gt;imagining an e-lit remediations&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/team-2-caleb-williams-the-matrix&quot;&gt;charting correspondences&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Caleb Williams&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;); situating ourselves as masters of the material helped us become masters of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4b. Edition Take-away:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;An important moment in the life of a graduate student is shifting one&#39;s relationship with knowledge from student to master (from mostly reception to scholarly creation). Similarly, the moment the reader of an edition shifts from simply reading the text as he would a non-scholarly edition and begins to make use of the intricacies of the form is an important one; an even bigger step is when the reader is able to contribute back to the edition. Making sure our users can do this, whether through annotation, curation, or some other method (blog posts on how they&#39;ve used the edition in their own work, scholarly or otherwise?)–and modeling how to do these things well–are smart pedagogical steps.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5a. Seminar Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Always one of my favorite parts of a class: hearing what course ideas have caught fire in other students&#39; minds and what they plan to make of those ideas. Technoro&#39;s projects were especially interesting because they often built on team skill-building from earlier in the course, where students either learned to do basic TEI encoding for manuscript pages of &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; or to produce and understand topic models of Gothic texts. A good seminar encourages specialization of students&#39; research beyond the main concerns of the class and supports communication of that specialized learning through final class projects that are shared with the entire class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5b. Edition Take-away:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Every edition is a work of the editor&#39;s interpretation; every reading experience of an edition is an interpretation as well, and if you give the reader a path for communicating that interpretation she&#39;ll add to the collective pool of knowledge about a text. Similar to the previous take-away, let readers reflect their experience of the text by adding and/or curating annotations and related media–but also consider opening up your marked-up text so that users can create and submit different themes, functions, and interfaces with different interpretive resonances (more on difficulties, practical strategies, and existing work on editions as APIs in a future post).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Book Ghouls: Grangerizing as Book Hacking's Black Sheep</title>
   <link href="/2012/11/04/book-ghouls-grangerizing-as-book-hackings-black-sheep"/>
   <updated>2012-11-04T21:04:30-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/11/04/book-ghouls-grangerizing-as-book-hackings-black-sheep</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update, 7/18/2013: My Archbooks Architecture of the Book Encyclopedia article on Grangerizing is now available: &lt;a href=&quot;http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook//grangerizing.php&quot; &gt;http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook//grangerizing.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grangerizing is the expansion of a published book through the addition of illustrative images such as prints and etchings, as well as (to a lesser extent) textual material such as correspondence and playbills. Images are affixed on extra pages rebound into the codex (i.e. interleaves) or simply added on top of the existing text. This visual form of annotation is named after James Granger, an eighteenth-century collector, clergyman, and writer whose early use of the technique was rewritten as its origin; the technique was in vogue in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before the rise of cheap printed images and books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devotees of the popular hobby of Grangerizing argued that their reuse of visual material from other books was an “exquisite handicraft” that made use of texts that would otherwise have been junked (“Extending”). This reuse was another factor where Grangerizing and extra-illustration tended to differ; Grangerizers freely cannibalized other books to find the best images for their chosen text, while “extra-illustration” was a term usually applied to techniques that did not leave other books mutilated (Jackson 186). This cutting up of books caused a divide among book collectors as well as controversy with the general public; where the Grangerizers saw their work as curation and preservation of the best in image and text, others pointed to the increasing likelihood of encountering mutilated books with images (and often nearby text) snipped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the book collectors whose goal was to preserve fine and historically interesting volumes as they were created, Grangerizing was a perversion of a long-celebrated activity–according to an 1892 critic, “‘breaking up a good book to illustrate a worse one” (“Extending”). The author of the 1809 treatise The Bibliomania speaks of “the mischief which this passion for collecting prints has occasioned” (Jackson 189). &lt;strong&gt;Bibliographic discussions from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are replete with colorful invective against the Grangerizers’ depredations, for which Holbrook Jackson&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Anatomy of Bibliomania&lt;/em&gt; is a rich and lighthearted source&lt;/strong&gt; (especially the chapter &quot;Grangeritis Diagnosed&quot;). Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;as he that is bitten with a mad dog bites others, and all in the end become mad; either out of affection of novelty, vanity, or blind zeal, the giddy-headed will embrace the deep intricacies of Granger, and without farther examination approve them&quot; (Ferriar as cited in Holbrook Jackson 576)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Grangeritis… is a very general and violent symptom; the patient is a sort of literary Attila or Gengis Khan, who has spread terror and ruin around him; and he pursues his obscene passion with fiendish fascination: the moment Irving Brown came into possession of a book, it was put under the rack to extort its capacity for illustration. Of one hundred books extended by the insertion of prints which were not madefor them, ninety-nine are ruined; the hundredth book is no longer a book: it is a museum, or at best, a crazyquilt made of patches cut out of gowns of queens and scullions.&quot; (Burton, Locker-Lampson, Bulloch, &quot;A lawyer of Troy, U.S.A.&quot;, Tredwell, and H. P. du Bois as cited by Holbrook Jackson 577)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;by Granger school&#39;d&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;In Paper-books, superbly gilt and tool&#39;d,&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;He pastes, from injur&#39;d volumes snipt away,&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;His English Heads, in chronicled array&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ferriar as cited in Holbrook Jackson 578)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;May the spectre of Thomas Frognall Dibdin haunt the souls of these impious rascals, and torture them with never-ceasing visions of unobtainable and rare portraits, non-existent autographs, and elusive engravings&quot; (Willaim P. Cutter as cited in Holbrook Jackson 580)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Andrew Lang stoutly declares such a Book-Ghoul to be more hateful than the biblioklept, because he combines larceny with destruction: He is a collector of title-pages, frontispieces, illustrations, and look-plates. He prowls furtively among public and private libraries, inserting wetted threads, which slowly eat away the illustrations he covets; and he broods, like the obscene demon of Arabian superstitions, over the fragments of the mighty dead. He divides this variety into three classes: The antiquarian ghoul who steals title-pages and colophons. The aesthetic ghoul who cuts illuminated initials out of manuscripts; and the petty, trivial,and almost idiotic ghoul of our own days, who sponges the fly-leaves and boards of books for the purpose of cribbing the book-plates. This type is still regarded as a Book-Ghoul, even though his aim is grangerization. Uncompromising book-collectors branded James Gibbs, the grangerite-bookseller, as a book ghoul, a reptile who regards title-page and colophon as his natural prey&quot; (Andrew Lang, Locker-Lampson as cited in Holbrook Jackson 573)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Testing DH Sites: More on Use, Usability, and Usefulness</title>
   <link href="/2012/11/03/the3us"/>
   <updated>2012-11-03T01:00:03-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/11/03/the3us</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fourth post in a &lt;a title=&quot;DH Evaluation: A Three-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/3partdheval&quot;&gt;four-part series&lt;/a&gt; on user testing for DH projects. On Wednesday I discussed some ways of doing “&lt;a title=&quot;Quick and Dirty DH User Testing&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/quickdirtydhusertesting&quot;&gt;Quick and Dirty DH User Testing&lt;/a&gt;”, on Thursday, I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/01/amateurinthearchive&quot;&gt;my work with user testing for “amateur” user audiences&lt;/a&gt;, and on Friday I shared &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/02/dhusertestlist&quot;&gt;some examples of DH user testing and evaluation&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve encountered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Unsworth (1997) (Unsworth, J. (1997). Documenting the Reinvention of Text: The Importance of Failure. &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Electronic Publishing&lt;/em&gt;, 3(2). Retrieved August 21, 2009, from http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;view=text;rgn=main;idno=3336451.0003.201.) argues that the benefits of hypertext (and other aspects of the digital humanities as well) need to be testable. To claim that digital texts offer benefits beyond those of print texts, digital humanists must be able to point to a theory that could potentially be disproven:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p  style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;When a theorist of hypertext does make claims of a factual nature (such as the claim that hypertext is an improvement over the state of text in printed form)... (he) has obliged himself or herself to support those claims with empirical evidence and rational argument... &lt;strong&gt;If we do think that we are &quot;reinventing the text&quot;... then we must have a theory to guide that research, and it must be possible for that theory to be proven wrong by the evidence. In short, if failure isn&#39;t a possibility, neither is discovery.&lt;/strong&gt; (Unsworth, emphasis added)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That digital texts offer a plethora of tools not found with traditional resources is not being debated. Whether or not these tools are actually in frequent use and benefiting their users has not received enough attention; digital humanists must assess not the quality of the digital text as an idealized resource, but its value when accessed by real scholars on a daily basis. Being so closely tied to a digital texts&#39; development, scholar users of a digital text can quickly voice any issues with the project they are using; amateur users cannot similarly voice their needs. Thus, evaluating the value of real use by amateur digital text users is of great importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amateur audiences may form the majority of users for many digital texts, and the digital humanities world is ready for a formal evaluation of this group&#39;s needs and perceptions. If the use value offered by digital texts in contrast to traditional resources seems obvious, then producing empirical evidence of these benefits should pose no problem—and yet, as demonstrated above, very little in the way of scientifically conducted testing of digital texts has taken place. (There are certainly good practical reasons for this--funding and time being the foremost.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital humanists can remedy this lack of scientific proof of digital texts&#39; value to users. First, &lt;strong&gt;digital humanists can test the structure of a digital text, examining the system that delivers resources to the user;&lt;/strong&gt; this involves&lt;strong&gt; a usability approach&lt;/strong&gt; that follows users in their functional interactions with a site&#39;s interface. Digital texts can potentially assist scholarly users with many tasks. The Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities (2006) (&lt;em&gt;Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities&lt;/em&gt;(Report from the September 28-30, 2005 Summit). (2006). The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities: University of Virginia. Retrieved August 20, 2009, from http://www.iath.virginia.edu/dtsummit/SummitText.pdf.) identified four areas where attendees believed technology could aid humanities work: &quot;interpretation, exploration of resources, collaboration, and visualization of time, space, &amp; uncertainty&quot; (p. 5). John Unsworth (2000) (Unsworth, J. (2000). Scholarly Primitives: What Methods Do Humanities Researchers Have in Common, and How Might Our Tools Reflect This? (Part of a symposium on “Humanities Computing: Formal Methods, Experimental Practice” sponsored by King&#39;s College, London, May 13, 2000). Retrieved August 20, 2009, from http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth//Kings.5-00/primitives.html.) provides a different list—“discovering, annotating, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and representing”—as basic human activities simple or “primitive” enough to be easily transferable to humanities computing. These individual features and tools of a digital text can be tested by straightforward usability studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, digital humanists can &lt;strong&gt;identify the value of a digital text&#39;s content&lt;/strong&gt; by looking at the &lt;strong&gt;usefulness&lt;/strong&gt; of the content to the scholar. Such a study would test the relevance of a digital text to its proposed audience, measuring the relatedness of the material to a project&#39;s users’ research (Saracevic, 2007a, p. 1918) (Saracevic, T. (2007a). Relevance: A Review of the Literature and a Framework for Thinking on the Notion in Information Science. Part II: Nature and Manifestations of Relevance. &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;58&lt;/em&gt;(13), 1915-1933.). Saracevic (2007b) (Saracevic, T. (2007b). Relevance: A Review of the Literature and a Framework for Thinking on the Notion in Information Science. Part III: Behavior and Effects of Relevance. &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;58&lt;/em&gt;(13), 2126-2144.) examined relevance studies that looked at user assessments of web pages, including comments on decision-making and measures of perceived usefulness and authority (p. 2127).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, digital humanists can &lt;strong&gt;identify the value of a digital text&#39;s content&lt;/strong&gt; by looking at an audience&#39;s&lt;strong&gt; use&lt;/strong&gt; of a digital text; such a study would look at user behavior, assessing what users are trying to do with a site and how they go about doing it. A measure of use is different from a measure of usefulness; where usefulness looks to the relevance of content to an audience, evaluating use requires looking at the efficacy of a digital text after its usefulness has been established or assumed (Park, 2000, p. 461) (Park, S. (2000). Usability, User Preferences, Effectiveness, and User Behaviors when Searching Individual and Integrated Full-Text Databases: Implications for Digital Libraries. &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Society for Information Science,&lt;/em&gt; 51(5): 456-468.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My master’s thesis study focused on the last of these three value assessments, use. The least well-established benefit of digital texts is not the offloading of scholarly chores, but assistance to scholars in making new inferences and connections as suggested by their personal paths through material that is &quot;both interactive and non-linear... a non-narrative experience for the user&quot; (Katz, 2005, p. 113) (Katz, S. (2005). Why Technology Matters: The Humanities in the Twenty-First Century. &lt;em&gt;Interdisciplinary Science Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, 30(2), 105-118.). Judging the worth of an entire digital text—that sum greater than the tools and resources it contains—is not as easy as quantifying the efficacy of individual features and can be accomplished with neither usability or relevance studies; instead, a digital text&#39;s worth should be judged by whether users are answering their research queries when using that resource, or coming to new, unforeseen realizations. Figuring out the worth of the whole digital text, rather than its component features, requires probing scholars&#39; perceptions of their digital text use.&lt;strong id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.08296723710373044&quot;&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the third post in a &lt;a title=&quot;DH Evaluation: A Three-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/3partdheval&quot;&gt;four-part series&lt;/a&gt; on user testing for DH projects. On Wednesday I discussed some ways of doing “&lt;a title=&quot;Quick and Dirty DH User Testing&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/quickdirtydhusertesting&quot;&gt;Quick and Dirty DH User Testing&lt;/a&gt;”; on Thursday, I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/01/amateurinthearchive&quot;&gt;my work with user testing for “amateur” user audiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&#39;d like to share some research on DH user testing that I&#39;ve found useful in my own work. These are sorted by focus and field and include some comments on the state of digital evaluation. I wrote my master’s thesis shortly after finding out that what I was doing was digital humanities, so the list of studies above surely misses out on some good DH evaluation work that I just wasn&#39;t aware of/didn&#39;t locate (the list also doesn&#39;t cover more recent research--something I&#39;ll remedy as I blog more about the new user study work I&#39;m doing as part of my Ph.D. dissertation).:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Studying usage patterns of digital humanities resources: &lt;/strong&gt;The LAIRAH (Log Analysis of Internet Resources in the Arts and Humanities) Project worked directly with users to determine &quot;factors that may predispose a digital resource to become used or neglected in the long-term&quot; (Warwick, Terras, Huntington, &amp; Pappa, 2007) Warwick, C., Terras, M., Huntington, P., &amp; Pappa, N. (2008). If You Build It Will They Come? The LAIRAH Study: Quantifying the Use of Online Resources in the Arts and Humanities through Statistical Analysis of User Log Data. Literary and Linguistic Computing 23(1), pp. 85-102..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Usability work geared at improving individual projects or features:&lt;/strong&gt; Don et. al.&#39;s 2007 work Don, A., Zheleva, E., Gregory, M., Tarkan, S., Auvil, L., Clement, T., Shneiderman, B., &amp; Plaisant, C. 2007.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Wants to Know?&lt;/strong&gt; Even in those studies that might benefit digital text development, the multiple agendas at play in the interpretation of digital resource user studies, from institution administrators to resource developers, may baffle those digital text creators who try to sound out their entire potential audience as to how “an exceptionally diverse set of digital resources is actually used&quot; (Harley et al., 2006, section 1-2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reports. &lt;/strong&gt;Several reports found that most digital cultural collections only informally model their intended audience and have made a call for the disciplined evaluation of digital text users. These reports include&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

NINCH similarly found that digital texts are often erroneously designed around assumptions about user&#39;s needs based on “existing usage of analog resources” (2003). Such assumptions ignore the new possibilities presented by digital resources: &quot;for instance, use of postcard collections has always been limited, but when made available in digital form their use rises dramatically; ease of access is the key” (NINCH). The discovery of such new uses for digitized materials underlines the need for direct user evaluation: “only by carrying out evaluation with our users can we find out how the digital resources we create are actually being used” (NINCH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing ubiquity of the digital text is paralleled by the increasing importance of empirical evidence for the worth of these projects and for the needs of their users. Digital text developers need to formally gather feedback from amateur users, rather than developing user personae through thought experiments or relying on informal models of their needs; if it seems obvious to us that what we create is useful, we should be able to develop metrics that demonstrate this success less subjectively.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Amateur in the Archive: Toward a Wider Audience for Your DH Project</title>
   <link href="/2012/11/01/amateurinthearchive"/>
   <updated>2012-11-01T08:00:27-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/11/01/amateurinthearchive</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second post in a &lt;a title=&quot;DH Evaluation: A Three-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/3partdheval&quot;&gt;four-part series&lt;/a&gt; on user testing for DH projects. Yesterday, I discussed some ways of doing “&lt;a title=&quot;Quick and Dirty DH User Testing&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/quickdirtydhusertesting&quot;&gt;Quick and Dirty DH User Testing&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing my form of communication* reminds me of my audience. The challenges of communicating through the digital highlight the corresponding issues faced by readers of this non-traditionally presented content. My master’s thesis involved a user study evaluating the use of well-established digital humanities archives by a wider audience, a group I still refer to as “amateurs”, and it’s an awareness of this specific audience for our work that I’m discussing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of DH creations with advanced scholarly uses, “amateurs” as I’m defining them are a sometimes under-served group--not the relatively small circle of creators and colleagues at the center of a digital archive’s realization, but the nebulous audience just beyond that inner circle: “amateurs” in the old sense of people whose pursuits aren&#39;t undertaken in a professional role, but are followed with passion, competence, and curiosity--the humanist geek latent in all of us*. For example, instead of assessing the &lt;em&gt;Blake Archive&lt;/em&gt;’s use by it’s developer-users and other Blake scholars using the site as a primary resource for their professional work, I’m interested in users without this degree of specific content knowledge about Blake (some with overlapping knowledges, e.g. art historians, non-Romanticist literary scholars, artists and printers, and creative writers, and some with no relationship to Blake, e.g. the casual reader of poetry) and/or without the familiarity with DH commonplaces and digital archive design that make navigation and use of such sites more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Collaboratively Curating Early Modern Texts&quot;, Martin Mueller argues (in the context of crowdsourcing) that this audience encompasses anyone motivated by &quot;duty, fame, and love: the amateur scholar, the citizen scholar, and everybody else who would like to be recognized for something useful or splendid they have done”. Whether we’re seeking their assistance or making our scholarly efforts meaningful outside of the people who already have advanced knowledge in our field, the digital placement of our work means that it’s more easily accessible to more people* than thirty years ago--but virtual access doesn’t mean much if new site visitors are bouncing off your archive without using it. (Check out Section 2.1 “ Two Types of Digital Text Users” in &lt;a href=&quot;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380&quot;&gt;my master’s thesis&lt;/a&gt; for more on types of users for digital humanities archive projects, or &lt;a title=&quot;Quick and Dirty DH User Testing&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/quickdirtydhusertesting&quot;&gt;yesterday’s post&lt;/a&gt; on how you can tell if people aren’t staying on your DH website for more than a few second.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jandl Agency&#39;s Wikipedia Ads&quot; src=&quot;/assets/wiki-153x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;153&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;The Jandl ad agency&#39;s Wikipedia series is an eloquent reminder that the academy isn&#39;t the only place to nurture a love of learning. (Click image for more credit info and close-ups.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t mean to argue that every piece of DH work needs to serve a general as well as a scholarly audience.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s much to be said (e.g. on &lt;a href=&quot;http://humanistica.ualberta.ca&quot;&gt;4humanities&lt;/a&gt;) on the worth of humanities as public service, as the preservers and curators and teachers of culture (something enjoyably expressed by Ernest Cline’s novel &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;). On the other hand, I don’t think it unreasonable that any mid- to large-scale project should acknowledge that people will want to use their content in unexpected ways or without specialized knowledge of either the content area or DH commonplaces of form and navigation. With with everyone&#39;s limited funding, though, it’s entirely understandable why we don’t have many DH user tests or sites geared at diverse users--and that acknowledgement of these users might need to be more of a nod than a hearty welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are ways of serving a wider audience with your DH site that don’t need to take too much time or effort, and can also serve the scholars at the core of your user audience: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tours and introductions to the site’s structure and content (e.g. the Blake Archive has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blakearchive.org/blake&quot;&gt;lovely tour&lt;/a&gt; of their offerings behind the intro page),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intuitive interfaces or explanations of making meaningful serendipitous discovery within a set of objects (&lt;a href=&quot;http://utc.iath.virginia.edu&quot;&gt;Uncle Tom’s Cabin and American Culture&lt;/a&gt; does a good job at supporting browsing rather than searching; each object is contextualized on the same page), or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focused teaching tools and exercises that help the reader learn to think like a scholar in your field (e.g. the Dickinson Electronic Archive’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.emilydickinson.org/safe/exercises/reorder.html&quot;&gt;Emily Dickinson Writing a Poem: Manuscript Ordering Exercise&lt;/a&gt;”, which seems to no longer work but is a great idea).&lt;strong id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.08296723710373044&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital texts (online scholarly editions, digital archives, thematic research collections, literary engagements, etc.) promise learning beyond that possible with traditional resources--new connections, serendipitous discovery, themes rising out of giant texts corpora. Purpose-built digital texts (as opposed to general-audience sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html&quot; &gt;the LOC’s American Memory project&lt;/a&gt;) are crafted for specific research purposes, with developer-users and devoted academics comprising their primary, &quot;scholar&quot; audience--but a secondary, &quot;amateur&quot; audience of learners with less digital text or content experience also relies on these purpose-built resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my master’s thesis user study, I asked: Does the promise of new learning from digital texts extend beyond scholars to amateurs, or does the design of purpose-built digital texts, by focusing on more experienced users with direct lines of communication to digital text developers, prevent this extension of benefits? This 2009-2010 study gauged one subgroup of amateur users&#39; perceptions of the value of digital texts in terms of answering self-generated research queries. The participants, graduate students from the University of Michigan&#39;s information master&#39;s program, worked with a digital archive (either the Blake or Whitman project) and provided narrative and survey data assessing their experience of digital text features and perception of their learning success. An analysis of the survey data produced an introductory understanding of amateur users&#39; perceptions of their digital text use, their design needs, and their success or failure at learning through digital texts, an understanding I hope to deepen as part of my Ph.D. dissertation work. The study gathered data about amateur-audience digital text use in three areas: general use, nature and success of research queries, and the interplay between experience with digital texts and success at achieving new knowledge. I decided to focus on digital archive &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt;, assessing these resources by whether users were answering their research queries when using that resource; questions pertaining to digital text usefulness (i.e. relevance of the digital text to the amateur audience) and usability (e.g. efficacy of individual features, site structure) were avoided as outside this study&#39;s scope (&lt;a title=&quot;Quick and Dirty DH User Testing&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/quickdirtydhusertesting&quot;&gt;see yesterday’s post for more on the differences among use, usability, and usefulness in user studies&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to be specific about what audience you are targeting with your using testing, as it’s important to know who is your site’s primary audience. I’m particularly interested in ways we can serve both scholars and a wider audience as public service, teaching, and for the love of sharing things we care about deeply. &lt;a title=&quot;DH User Testing: What’s Been Done? (Adding to a Growing List of Resources)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/02/dhusertestlist&quot;&gt;Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll discuss my experience collecting exemplars of DH evaluation and user study research for my own user study, providing some suggestions on readings and example metrics for anyone interested in testing how their digital work is being used. Meanwhile--I&#39;d love to hear about ways you&#39;ve reached out to a wider or amateur audience with your DH work!&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
* ...And that&#39;s any unaccustomed form. Needing to justify the code-heavy format of my Ph.D. dissertation has been a useful exercise for me, but I think it would be a useful tool for any traditional dissertator as well. As a textual scholar, I’m convinced that awareness of medium can only lead to work that more meaningfully harnesses the unique features of that form (as well as recognizes its limitations).
* As I define amateur in an unconventionally positive way, here’s my positive definition of “geek”, courtesy of Simon Pegg: “Being a geek is all about being honest about what you enjoy and not being afraid to demonstrate that affection. It means never having to play it cool about how much you like something.&quot;
* But not to everyone. I&#39;ll be blogging in the future about my work as a programmer with the MITH/BrailleSC &quot;Making the Digital Humanities Open&quot; partnership, which will make Wordpress, Omeka, and other web content accessible via braille and screen readers</content>

   <title>Quick and Dirty DH User Testing</title>
   <link href="/2012/10/31/quickdirtydhusertesting"/>
   <updated>2012-10-31T08:00:25-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/10/31/quickdirtydhusertesting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first post in a &lt;a title=&quot;DH Evaluation: A Three-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/31/3partdheval&quot;&gt;four-part series&lt;/a&gt; on user testing for DH projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start extremely practical: &lt;strong&gt;what we can do in a single day towards user testing our own small-scale DH tools and projects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of affinity diagram on wall made of post-it notes&quot; src=&quot;/assets/affinitywall-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot;&gt;To know the affinity diagram is to fear it! Although it&#39;s a useful assessment tool, I&#39;ll be recommending some kinder ways of evaluating how your DH project treats its audience. (Photo by author&#39;s contextual inquiry team, Fall 2009)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Analytics! Analytics! Analytics! (Know Thy Audience)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you have no funding and only an hour of free time, I cannot see any reason for not installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/analytics&quot; &gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; on your DH project website (or your blog or portfolio, for that matter). Google Analytics tracks visitors to your site and gives you information like your site’s busiest days of the week, how long visitors are spending on any given page, whether your readers are using mobile devices to access your site, and where in the world your visitors are from. All this is not only fascinating and flattering (&lt;em&gt;neat! people are looking at your work!&lt;/em&gt;), but it helps you build a better website and project by giving you some free information on who’s interested in what pages of your site, and what kind of technological needs they have for accessing your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop me a comment if you&#39;d enjoy a post on setting up and generating custom reports with Google Analytics to find out who’s using your DH website and how. It’s pretty easy to set up, though (but generating customized reports is a bit tricky): on any site, you can insert some lines of code the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/analytics&quot; &gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; site will give you to start tracking; if you’re running Wordpress (WP), this is even easier: behold, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress&quot;&gt;Google Analytics plugin&lt;/a&gt;! (On WP, you’ve probably also got the nifty Jetpack statistics running, which provide less powerful but still useful analyses of your site users than Google Analytics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. What Do You Want to Study About Your Users?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your time and money is limited, it might help to separate out &lt;strong&gt;what you most care about studying about your audience&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability:&lt;/strong&gt; Can your site &lt;em&gt;be used&lt;/em&gt; as you intend? Is it difficult to navigate or to understand how the content is presented? To assess usability, you might give a set of readers the same task to achieve through your site (e.g. “Tell me about how and why James Joyce’s drafts look different at different stages of writing”) and observe the time and steps each reader takes to provide you with an answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Usability or Bad Usability&lt;/strong&gt;?: In a study headed by Jan Spyridakis*, researchers found that ease of retention of visually-accessed knowledge often meant... bad usability! Design that interrupts narrative flow, exercises working memory, and forces readers to establish context all served to better retention of information. When trying to apply understandings of the reading brain to DH project design, we really need to understand more about humanities-specific reading (i.e. long texts and research reading patterns). As we design for research and learning, we need to ask ourselves whether we are aiming at use or usability--do we want the user to go our way or their way? Are there ways to make these more compatible ends?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; are people using your site--as intended, or for other ends? Using a tool like Google Analytics is a start toward knowing who’s using your stuff, but to go beyond demographics and what pages are getting visited, you’ll need to think about a tactic like soliciting use stories from site visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usefulness:&lt;/strong&gt; If your site can be used as intended (usability), is it &lt;em&gt;actually helping&lt;/em&gt; the people you’re looking to serve? A simple, quick embedded survey (e.g. from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.surveymonkey.com&quot; &gt;SurveyMonkey&lt;/a&gt;, which I think gives a free upgraded version to graduate students--at least it did in 2009) can let your visitors tell you whether they found what they were looking for, had any issues with your navigation or comprehension, or would like to see something new on your site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Build On Existing Metrics (Standards of Measurement)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on what you’re studying, you don’t necessarily need to build a metric from scratch--in fact, in some cases it’s best to adapt previous work. Here’s a section from my master’s thesis on basing my metrics on other researchers’ work, with the plainspeak take-aways below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instrument (metric I used to conduct research) is a combination of pieces of &lt;strong&gt;two pre-existing instruments derived for research on similar topics&lt;/strong&gt;. A study by Koohang (2004)* assessed the usability of e-learning courseware with a focus on user&#39;s perceptions of the courseware&#39;s usability, &lt;strong&gt;much as the current&lt;/strong&gt; study assesses learner&#39;s perceptions of digital text features and use; &lt;strong&gt;both Koohang&#39;s work and this study also looked at&lt;/strong&gt; the effect of technology experience on user experience and educational success. A study by Harley et al. (2006)* assessed digital resource use in the undergraduate humanities and social sciences; &lt;strong&gt;as with the current study&lt;/strong&gt;, Harley&#39;s emphasized the need for user studies to empirically understand the desires of users of digital learning tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Likert item questions (spectrum of answers indicated by radio buttons) drew from both of the instruments used in these previous studies, as &lt;strong&gt;they provided a tested example of the assessment of a digital resource&#39;s user experience&lt;/strong&gt;. The analysis of quantitative data also drew from Koohang&#39;s (2004) study; &lt;strong&gt;where&lt;/strong&gt; Koohang compared years of Internet experience with assessments of e-learning courseware usability using ANOVAs, this study compared years of Internet experience and degree of experience with digital texts with the results of ten scaled-response questions assessing digital text use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote my master’s thesis shortly after finding out that what I was doing was digital humanities, so I’m certain my master&#39;s thesis discussion of the lack of DH user studies misses out at least good DH evaluation work that had been done before 2009, though not for lack of searching--such work is still difficult to locate (thus, the DH Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/2012/10/solicitating-writing-on-assessment-and-evaluation-of-dh-work&quot;&gt;solicitation for writing on these topics&lt;/a&gt;). What isn’t as difficult is finding evaluation work from other domains such as education and computer science that can be useful in assessing at least your website-based work (e.g. the Koohang study mentioned above, which studies perceptions of usability instead of usability). I&#39;ve bolded all the parallels I drew between their studies and mine; don&#39;t forget to be clear in any public write-up you create from your testing justifying how the metrics you created/adpated were the right ones (social science papers provide some good tips on how such a write-up differs from a traditional humanities paper).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a lot of time or experience with user testing, finding an existing metric that applies to your questions about audience means you can spend less time worrying whether your results will say what you think they say, and more time analyzing those results when you get them. Not only is it good to not reinvent the wheel, adapting another researchers’ metric (remember to cite!) lets you read about how that metric was applied and what the results and issues with the tool were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hope these quick ideas were helpful! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/01/amateurinthearchive&quot;&gt;Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ll be writing about a specific user audience that interests me: &quot;amateur&quot; users, aka citizen scholars or interested audience members from outside the academy/alt-ac world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Five Tips for Getting Started on a Digital Humanities Dissertation</title>
   <link href="/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation"/>
   <updated>2012-10-21T23:53:32-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you might have noticed from this blog and my tweets, I&#39;m in the opening act of what promises to be an exciting and non-traditional doctoral literature dissertation. I&#39;ll be blogging the actual content of the dissertation in the months to come, but for now I&#39;d like to share some of the things that have helped me mediate between my digital and humanist goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the beginning of writing the prospectus, identify all roles that have advisory and/or control relationships to the final form of your dissertation, and &lt;strong&gt;ask them to acknowledge in writing the conditions under which they will accept the dissertation format you propose&lt;/strong&gt;. I talked with our library’s digital repository (which ingests dissertations), the graduate school (which has final say in granting my degree), my graduate department (to help them understand how my dissertation format choice is good both for me and for the department), and my dissertation committee (of course!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate a monthly schedule for completing both the digital work (coding, metadata, whatever) and writing for your project.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Have options in place&lt;/strong&gt; in case a) coding takes longer than planned and/or b) you need to make changes from the code you originally planned to create (e.g. it’s too hard to do or someone else does it first).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With all the members of your dissertation committee, &lt;strong&gt;hold a meeting that is focused on practical aspects of your dissertation’s running and marketing&lt;/strong&gt; (both to non-DH members of your department and the larger community). You’ll likely need to do some extra work over a traditional dissertation’s requirements to justify the format of your dissertation and how it fits into your degree program (in my case, literature); &lt;strong&gt;this is actually a really helpful, mindful exercise that I think all students should do whether or not they’re producing digital work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan towards eventual publication of your work&lt;/strong&gt;, considering both traditional venues and more recent projects that can handle both writing and new media projects. If you’ll be blogging as part of the process, consider how this writing can become part of the finished project, whether it can be republished, and the risks and rewards of early publication. Think about how the nature of what you can publish out of your dissertation will affect your job prospects (e.g. students seeking tenure-track teaching positions need to think carefully if they’re not creating something very book-like).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be clear on your career goals and what skills you’d like to improve over the coming years of your dissertation&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;identify who will be supporting the more technological aspects of your project&lt;/strong&gt;. How can you use your dissertation to develop and demonstrate these skills? Think not just about improving existing skills or honing one ability, but about diversifying your skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I successfully defended my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;digital humanities doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt; in Spring 2015. The now-available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; social+digital reading platform is part of that project; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;come read with us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>The beauty of DH: We're all continually n00bs at something</title>
   <link href="/2012/10/07/the-beauty-of-dh-were-all-continually-n00bs-at-something"/>
   <updated>2012-10-07T05:25:33-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/10/07/the-beauty-of-dh-were-all-continually-n00bs-at-something</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross-posted from a long comment to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hastac.org/blogs/agmullen/2012/10/05/digital-humanities-impostor-syndrome&quot; &gt;HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory)&lt;/a&gt; post by Abby Mullen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over on HASTAC, Abby Mullen writes about &quot;DH imposter syndrome&quot; for people new to DH. My reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great thing about DH is that even for people who&#39;ve been involved for several years (e.g. me) or many years (as with many of my co-workers at MITH and my graduate advisors), there will always be large areas of DH work where each of us is ignorant. Sure, there are commonplaces and vocabulary that everyone picks up over time, as well as a sense of some of the more-trodden discussions (e.g. the community attitude toward big data, small data, deep data; toward defining what is DH and who is a DHer; and towards games and education, online learning, and the scholarly status of digital creations). But if you go to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thatcamp.org&quot; &gt;THATCamp&lt;/a&gt; (which I heartily recommend if you haven&#39;t), you&#39;ll quickly notice that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the person with the most to say in one session is a complete n00b in a later session (people go to THATCamps to learn stuff they don&#39;t know!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that almost everyone there is excited to explain their work to anyone who will listen--and that explaining it to someone with no background in their area means that they&#39;ll get to hear new types of feedback, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that, much less than in the traditional humanities (though of course things aren&#39;t perfectly utopianic here either), you don&#39;t need to wait to ascend the hierarchy to get your projects seen, to talk in or lead a session (or even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thatcampgames.org&quot; &gt;run your own THATCamp&lt;/a&gt; on the THATCamp topic of your dreams!), or to learn skills and tools that allow you to do better work without the benefits of a full-time position, tenure, or much/any funding (e.g. Omeka, Zotero, Wordpress--all tools THATCampers teach at most Bootcamps that are free or require cheap hosting fees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DH, as I and many see it, has a strong pedagogical focus; part of everyone&#39;s work in their particular niche of DH (whether that&#39;s mapping, topic modeling, something else) is not only to do awesome things, but to share it with the DH community in a way that non-specialists can understand. There&#39;s also a great movement in DH toward a more public humanities aimed at people outside the academy who are passionantly curious about history, narrative, etc. (e.g. the &lt;a href=&quot;http://humanistica.ualberta.ca&quot;&gt;4humanities project&lt;/a&gt; and work that seeks to use the wisdom of the crowd for interpretive rather than mechanical tasks, such as the Scholars&#39; Lab&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://prism.scholarslab.org&quot;&gt;Prism,&lt;/a&gt; comments in the LOC historical photo Flickr stream, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://menus.nypl.org&quot;&gt;NYPL menus project&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t mean to say that you (or anyone) won&#39;t feel like an imposter for a while upon first getting involved in DH (or, as I&#39;ve pointed out, that you won&#39;t continue to feel like an imposter recurrently over the years as DH folds in new tools and approaches and disciplines). What I do mean to say is (from the viewpoint of a fellow grad student) that feeling like an imposter in DH is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actually more substantiated in DH than in the traditional humanities, and &lt;em&gt;that&#39;s a good thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; I think it&#39;s less scary to feel like you don&#39;t know enough when you actually don&#39;t and &lt;em&gt;can&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; possibly be an expert on everything that&#39;s going on. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tedunderwood.com/2012/09/22/how-everyone-gets-to-claim-they-do-dh&quot;&gt;As Ted Underwood recently pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, DH is less fakable than the traditional humanities because of the skill-learning and interdisicplinarity involved, but I take that to mean it frees everyone up to admit ignorance and n00bishness without losing professional face--and to get the help they desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not something that you should let make you feel like &quot;less DH&quot; than anyone else&lt;/strong&gt;; everyone was a n00b with every DH skill at one point, the proliferation of new tools and approaches means that everyone is going to be a n00b at something again and again, and the DH community is pretty good (and getting better) at offering opportunities online and off for learning about the stuff you want to know but don&#39;t yet understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the people smart Tweeps you already know are following, and don&#39;t be afraid to tweet at them when you don&#39;t follow something. CHNM&#39;s Tom Scheinfeldt has &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/36&quot; &gt;a great blog post/&lt;em&gt;Debates in DH&lt;/em&gt; chapter&lt;/a&gt; (the latter is another great resource for diving into DH, by the way: both chapters and really finely crafted blog posts covering a lot of the field&#39;s preoccupations) discussing how DH is a peculiarly &quot;nice&quot; field, in large part because of our emphasis on skills and methodology (so there&#39;s another benefit to those aspects of DH that make it a little harder to pick up). If someone&#39;s doing DH and they&#39;re not willing to at least say &quot;try going and reading this book/post/project site&quot;, they&#39;re going to be a bit anomalous. Also, don&#39;t be shy about tweeting a link when you have a new blog post, or to mention you Twitter handle frequently (I looked up your handle after reading this post, but I&#39;m usually more lazy about that!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&#39;s totally okay to not care about some aspects of the DH field; choose the things that help you do better work in areas you care about. Even if you don&#39;t know how your non-DH work relates to what people are doing digitally yet, DH probably relates way more than you can currently imagine. It did for me: I left college wanting to somehow mash up my love of complex books and making websites, then found out about online editions, topic modeling, text visualization, literary games... and a lot of other amazing things that people with similar interests were doing with digital tools. Finding out that other people were doing this stuff was an eye-opener! You know what you care about, so enlist others to help you find the DH work that might intrigue you or help you out, either through HASTAC posts, tweeting, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers&quot;&gt;DH Q&amp;A site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for anyone reading this who&#39;s intrigued by DH but hasn&#39;t gone to a THATCamp: you should. Really. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thatcamp.org&quot;&gt;the main page&lt;/a&gt; and look for one near you (some can also offer limited travel assistance to a few attendees), or tweet @thatcamp if you need help or reassurance that you&#39;ll fit in :) And yes, THATCamps are full of people just dipping their toes (or cannon-balling) into the DH waters, so it will be pretty impossible for you to feel like you don&#39;t fit in at one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2012-07-11T09:13:32-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;View the site related to this post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ&quot;&gt;digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Huge thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ach.org&quot;&gt;ACH&lt;/a&gt; for funding this work!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt1&quot;&gt;the first part of this blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed the results of a small visualization project funded by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ach.org/2012/04/19/ach-announces-microgrants-winners&quot;&gt;2012 ACH Microgrant&lt;/a&gt;: visualizing the flow of DH knowledge as captured by citation networks and other measures from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt;). You can view some of the products of the project &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, read more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/04/19/ach-microgrant-award&quot;&gt;the initial proposal&lt;/a&gt; here, or jump back to &lt;a title=&quot;View DHQ: Visualizing Data from Digital Humanities Quarterly (Part I of II)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt1&quot;&gt;Part One of this post&lt;/a&gt; to read more about the project&#39;s outcome. Now, I&#39;ll discuss some of the technical details of creating DH visualizations...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started with Gephi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta. &lt;/strong&gt;Gephi is free, open-source visualization software for Mac, Windows, and Linux available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gephi.org&quot;&gt;Gephi.org&lt;/a&gt;. Its beta status (currently 0.8.1-beta) meant I periodically ran into some small bugs (usually fixed by deleting the user library and reinstalling); the largest beta-style issue was that visualization images weren&#39;t exporting as editable files (e.g. SVGs), meaning I couldn&#39;t put on any final touches to the images using design software like Adobe Illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Terminology.&lt;/strong&gt; Outside these minor issues, I found it quite easy to start making basic visualizations with Gephi. As I began working with various datasets, I found my workflow fell into two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking about what I&#39;m trying to display--either specifics (&quot;I want to show how many steps it takes to connect Jean Valjean to any other character in &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&quot;&lt;/em&gt;), or a general sense of what kind of interesting things you&#39;re hoping to see pop out (&quot;How is knowledge being cited and reused in &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt;? What are some of the most frequently cited writings in DH?&quot;)--and structuring my dataset appropriately. What do you want to show, and what data must you record to model that idea?&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;DHQ Stack Issue&quot; alt=&quot;DHQ Stack Issue&quot; src=&quot;/assets/stack.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;323&quot;&gt;We worried that DHQ&#39;s 110 articles would show little interconnectedness, so we planned on adding additional measures to the visualizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importing the dataset into Gephi and working with the data through the visual interface--either experimentally (&quot;Let&#39;s try some different layouts and filters see if anything interesting pops up!&quot;) or with a predetermined purpose (&quot;I want to determine the five most frequently cited works in &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s citation set, then display how all the other articles and citations are webbed among these key five nodes&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gephi can handle complex data--e.g. a dynamic stream of Twitter hashtag results--but a dataset can also be a ridiculously simple thing, so this article will assume we&#39;re all working with some pretty basic sets of data. Some quick terminology might help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of a visualization as a bunch of objects connected by links--circles and lines, at the most simple level. The objects are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;called&lt;strong&gt; nodes&lt;/strong&gt; and the links are called &lt;strong&gt;edges&lt;/strong&gt;. Each visualization dataset will model various nodes and the way they are connected via edges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edges&lt;/strong&gt; can be given &lt;strong&gt;weights&lt;/strong&gt;, which are just some kind of quantitative measure that tells you something about each given edge between two nodes. One possible measure you could use to weight your edges is &lt;strong&gt;degree&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the number of edges connecting to a node, representing how interconnected that node is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualizations can be directed or undirected; &lt;strong&gt;directed&lt;/strong&gt; edges only point one way (from node A -&gt; node B but not also B -&gt; A), while &lt;strong&gt;undirected&lt;/strong&gt; edges point both ways. A dataset that records each and every character interaction in a book might choose to use &lt;strong&gt;directed&lt;/strong&gt; edges to connect character nodes if it were recording interactions such as thinking about or overhearing someone, while a similar dataset that only recorded interactions that are dialogues could be undirected, since the interaction modeled by the edge goes both ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My First &lt;del datetime=&quot;2012-07-11T08:56:58+00:00&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/del&gt; Dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the visualizations with &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; and with &lt;a title=&quot;O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve worked on recently, my datasets have largely been two- or three-column spreadsheets showing the relationship between a pair of items, plus sometimes a weight (i.e. some quantified measure of that relationship such as number of times a pair of characters meet). For the &lt;a title=&quot;O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; visualization&lt;/a&gt;, we simply had one column for the &quot;source&quot; (the node for a person leading the interaction) and one column for the &quot;target&quot; (the focus of that interaction). Thus, one row in a general &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; interaction dataset might have a source cell saying &quot;Bloom&quot; and a target cell saying &quot;Molly&quot;, to record a social interaction where the character Bloom spoke to Molly. Make sure that any nodes (your characters, articles, objects, etc.) that are mentioned multiple times within a dataset are always identified in the same way with the exact same spelling so that Gephi can identify each mention as referring to the same thing (e.g. we always referred to one character as Fr. Conmee, never sometimes as Father Conmee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Ulysses Wandering Rocks Dataset Snapshot&quot; alt=&quot;Ulysses Wandering Rocks Dataset Snapshot&quot; src=&quot;/assets/ulsvis.jpg&quot; width=&quot;586&quot; height=&quot;265&quot;&gt;A snapshot of part of the super-basic dataset spreadsheet for the &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first three &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; visualizations, I had &quot;source&quot;, &quot;target&quot;, and &quot;weight&quot; columns, where each row recorded data about one &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; article (the source), one of the articles in its bibliography (the target), and a weight for that edge (we decided to weigh edges by the number of times an item in an article&#39;s bibliography was explicitly cited in the main text of that article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&#39;ve set up a dataset (and there are other ways to do this, but for a simple dataset, importing a spreadsheet as a CSV is probably the easiest)--you&#39;re ready to check out your data in Gephi. Fire up the program and note the three main area tabs at the top of the interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt; is where you&#39;ll work with your dataset in visual form, trying out different layouts, filtering for specific data, customizing colors and labels, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laboratory &lt;/strong&gt;is where you can view a spreadsheet version of your dataset; when viewing a visualization image in the Overview, for example, you might want to right-click and select &quot;View in Data Laboratory&quot; to see the specifics of a given node. &lt;strong&gt;Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt; is also where you&#39;ll want to head to import your dataset (&quot;Import Spreadsheet&quot;), following &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Import-CSV-Data&quot; &gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; if you need a little extra help. Once you&#39;ve imported your dataset successfully, you can jump back to the &lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt; view to start playing with your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preview&lt;/strong&gt; is the pane for seeing how your final visualization looks to the world, allowing you to make final customizations (e.g. background and label coloring) and choose how to export your visualization (as noted above, .PNG seems to be the current best option for Mac users).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&#39;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Circular visualization of Les Miserables character interconnections&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Untitled1.png&quot; width=&quot;456&quot; height=&quot;456&quot;&gt;A quick visualization of character relations in the Gephi Les Miserables dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn Gephi is to import a dataset with which you&#39;re familiar; if you don&#39;t currently have one of your own, try opening the one of Gephi&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Datasets&quot;&gt;example datasets&lt;/a&gt; that is most familiar to you (perhaps it&#39;s the connections between characters in Victor Hugo&#39;s novel &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/em&gt;, or a network of nearly all (?) the Marvel superheroes). I&#39;ll cover a few of the many buttons and widgets below, but the best way to learn is probably to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;begin with Gephi&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gephi.github.io/users&quot;&gt;three basic tutorials,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check out Elijah Meeks and Molly Wilson’s beautiful work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhs.stanford.edu/dh/gephi/dhstanford2.html&quot;&gt;visualizing DH work at Stanford&lt;/a&gt; for an aspirational example,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and start trying out buttons in the Overview pane to see what they do (hover your cursor over most buttons for a helpful explanation of what each thing does)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gephi maintains a &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.gephi.org&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki&quot; &gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; that probably hold answers to most of your basic questions; also check out the list of Gephi &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugins&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt;, which add functionalities such as embedding zoomable visualizations in your web page and pulling data from Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Features to Explore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&#39;ve got your dataset imported and you&#39;re on the Overview pane:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play around with &lt;strong&gt;layouts&lt;/strong&gt; (bottom-left of page; select a layout form the drop-down menu, then hit &quot;run&quot; to begin the layout algorithm and &quot;stop&quot; when desired). Options include a &lt;strong&gt;circular&lt;/strong&gt; layout (arranges nodes alphabetically around the circle&#39;s edges, as with the &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/em&gt; visualization above), the &lt;strong&gt;force-directed&lt;/strong&gt; layout (which takes into account the tightness of interlinkages among nodes), &lt;strong&gt;expansion&lt;/strong&gt; (increases space among nodes for better readability), and the &lt;strong&gt;node adjust&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;noverlap&lt;/strong&gt; layouts (which also help your labels be readable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;filters&lt;/strong&gt; to highlight specific parts of your dataset (upper-right corner). For example, you can &lt;em&gt;filter out all but the most interconnected nodes&lt;/em&gt; by double-clicking Filters &gt; Topology &gt; Degree Range, then using the slider that appear at the bottom-right to choose for what range of degrees nodes should be displayed (you can also click the number at either end of the range and type in a number, if the slider isn&#39;t fine enough for your needs), then click &quot;filter&quot; to see the results. For example, we could use this filter on the &lt;em&gt;Les Mis&lt;/em&gt; dataset to only show characters who interact with at least three other characters by setting the minimum degree to 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust &lt;em&gt;edge, node, and label size and coloring&lt;/em&gt; using the &lt;strong&gt;ranking&lt;/strong&gt; options in the upper-left. For example, for the DHQ dataset (which weights edges by how many times a target citation is mentioned in the source node article) choose the edges tab underneath &quot;ranking&quot;, then choose the parameter &quot;weight&quot;. Use the tiny palette icon (upper-right of the pane, but below the drop-down menu) to choose a color scheme, the min/max fields to limit the sizes possible, and use the other small icons (upper-right of the pane, above the drop-down menu) to choose whether to effect edge color, label color, or node size. Click apply to see your changes.&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;View the site related to this post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ&quot;&gt;digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Huge thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ach.org&quot;&gt;ACH&lt;/a&gt; and their Microgrant project for funding this work!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I finished up a small project funded by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ach.org/2012/04/19/ach-announces-microgrants-winners&quot;&gt;2012 ACH Microgrant&lt;/a&gt;: visualizing the flow of DH knowledge as captured by citation networks and other measures from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt;). You can view some of the products of the project &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, read more about &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/04/19/ach-microgrant-award&quot;&gt;the initial proposal&lt;/a&gt; here, or read about how to make DH visualizations in &lt;a title=&quot;View DHQ: Getting Started with Gephi for DH Vis (Part II of II)&quot; href=&quot;/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt2&quot;&gt;Part Two of this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p  id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.10593006076464029&quot;&gt;This project proposed a visualization of &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;DHQ&#39;s citation network with an eye toward identifying the flow and reuse of key texts in the DH community. Previous DH citation network research focused on exploring which journals include DH work, not on which individual DH works are cited within journals; this microgrant allowed me to conduct preliminary explorations with rendering the existing DHQ citation content more easily analyzed through visualizations, as well as make some recommendations for future DHQ visualization work in terms of improving metadata (an area that&#39;s also being more thoroughly tackled by &lt;a href=&quot;https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=HD-51084-10&quot;&gt;this NEH-funded project&lt;/a&gt; on improving DH bibliographic data), creating a streamlined workflow for dynamically updating visualizations of DHQ content, and embedding visualizations on the DHQ site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work supported by this grant is mostly visible on the webpages at &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ&quot;&gt;digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ&lt;/a&gt;, which traces my project of visualizing DHQ through five visualizations. These visualizations outline several ways of seeing an interesting dataset: one with much potential to reflect meaningful issues of knowledge reuse and representation within the DH community, but also presenting some issues in terms of relatively small size (110 articles), limited interconnectedness of citations, and metadata markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;2nd DHQ Visualization&quot; alt=&quot;2nd DHQ Visualization&quot; src=&quot;/assets/2small.png&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;One of the visualizations produced during the project: &lt;strong&gt;who, when included in a work&#39;s bibliography, gets cited specifically a lot in the text of that article?&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All five visualizations relied on the full (as of April 2012) set of 110 DHQ articles, identified throughout by their XML IDs (e.g. dhq-000009) and scraped from the DHQ website by the code magic of MITH Assistant Director Travis Brown. The first three visualizations explore DHQ’s citation network through&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis1.html&quot;&gt;providing an overview&lt;/a&gt; of the dataset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis2.html&quot;&gt;exploring the frequency of “namechecking”&lt;/a&gt; in DHQ (if a work is cited by a DHQ article, how many times is that work cited by name in the main text of the article?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis3.html&quot;&gt;identifying the DHQ articles with the most interlinkages&lt;/a&gt; (how many other works cite it or are cited by it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset for these first three visualizations identifies 2,473 linked pairings between the 110 DHQ articles and each of the works cited within them. Recording how many times a cited work was mentioned within the article citing it as a &quot;weight&quot; to these links (e.g. the dhq-000105 article mentions a 2010 article by Cohen twice--once in the bibliography and once in the main article text--thus receiving a weight of 2) adds richness to this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;369 of these unique citations each only appear once in their DHQ article’s XML file (i.e. the work was mentioned in the bibliography but not in the main text, at least not with the correct XML ID tag). Most of the citations (2,458 of them) were mentioned in the main text and bibliography between 1-9 times, with only 15 articles with ten or more mentions in an article citing them; dhq-000093 (Molly Gage’s “Winesburg, Ohio: A Modernist Kluge”) was the extreme case, citing Sherwood Anderson’s &lt;em&gt;Winesburg, Ohio&lt;/em&gt; 44 times (suggesting it might be interesting to compare citation &quot;namechecking&quot; between more traditional literary articles and newer DH work...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two visualizations focus on the similarity among DHQ articles by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis4.html&quot;&gt;running a topic modeling process on the DHQ articles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis5.html&quot;&gt;identifying&lt;/a&gt; those DHQ articles identified by the topic modeling process as having the highest degree of document similarity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two visualizations used the 110 DHQ articles only (i.e. not the cited works as well, as in the first three images); the dataset used for these visualizations was produced by Travis Brown using the MALLET topic modeling package. This dataset identifies 5,996 linkages among DHQ articles (representing the linkages between each possible DHQ article pairing of two articles). Edge weights here represent degrees of document similarity among the DHQ articles; these weights record symmetrized KL-divergence, measuring the distance between probability distributions for each article such that the smallest divergence signifies articles with the closest topics. Check out Visualizations &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis4.html&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis5.html&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; for some thoughts on these images.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)</title>
   <link href="/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis"/>
   <updated>2012-06-26T15:01:28-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org&quot;&gt;THATCamp Prime&lt;/a&gt; this year, I led &lt;a href=&quot;http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/14/o-rocks-celebrating-bloomsday-dh-style&quot;&gt;a hack session&lt;/a&gt; where we discussed small digital Joycean projects we might take on that day and continue hacking at over the following weeks. Session participants were Anastasia Salter, Ben Schmidt, Chad Rutkowski (part of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulyssesseen.com&quot;&gt;Ulysses Seen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; team!), and Heather Prescott. I&#39;ve been working a lot with the great open-source visualization software &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gephi.org&quot;&gt;Gephi&lt;/a&gt; recently (I&#39;ll be posting about the visualizations of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; citations and articles I&#39;ve just finished up for an ACH Microgrant later this week!), so we decided to create a dataset that could be used in Gephi to make something both informative and pretty: a log of the social interactions among characters that could be turned into a social network visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chad read through the Wandering Rocks episode and logged a list of character interactions, which I then turned into a dataset and manipulated in Gephi to produce (click image for larger version):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Wandering Rocks visualization&quot; alt=&quot;Wandering Rocks visualization&quot; src=&quot;/assets/wanderingrocks1.png&quot; width=&quot;561&quot; height=&quot;382&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character nodes are weighted by the number of edges touching them (i.e. by how many interactions with other people a given character has), so unsurprisingly for anyone who&#39;s read &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, Father Conmee appears as one of the most connected characters in the episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next step will be to answer some questions about types of character interactions and include these answers in our dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we want to log the direction of an interaction to cover cases where, for example, and conversation is one-sided? (Yes, but this means creating two edges for every dialogue: Bloom &gt; Molly as well as Molly &gt; Bloom).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What counts as an interaction? (Telegrams, letters, overheard shouts in the street?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we handle time? (Is Bloom &gt; Molly recorded only one time in our &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; datatset, or every time they interact? If the latter, how do we decide when an interaction counts as ended?) If we can find a satisfactory and non-insanity causing way of coding this, we could create a time-lapse visualization of interactions in the novel, perhaps with some sort of cumulative or heatmapping feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to handle different types of interactions? We discussed assigning different numbered weights to interaction edges so that its easy to see the degree of interaction taking place (was a character imagining a conversation with Bloom, or actually talking to him?), but there&#39;s some difficulty in deciding what types of interaction are deeper than others in order to place these on a spectrum and make visual apprehension easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Schmidt also did some neat and quick work with the Circe episode, running a script to gather character names by grabbing the all-caps words in that section and mapping interactions stepwise by linking the names that appears next after a given character in the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll continue working on this project as we have time, so if you&#39;re interested in helping out, send us a tweet! The work involved is pretty easy: identifying a section of the novel you wish to attack, then making a list of the characters who interact and ID&#39;ing the type of interaction according to a scheme we&#39;re using.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What’s Up with Digital Editing Tools? (Summer Conference Edition)</title>
   <link href="/2012/06/14/whats-up-with-digital-editing-tools-summer-conference-edition"/>
   <updated>2012-06-14T08:30:14-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/06/14/whats-up-with-digital-editing-tools-summer-conference-edition</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve just returned from a whirlwind ten days of DH conferences. If I only paid attention to my mode of residence during the trip, I’d call this post “DH via Dorm Rooms”, but what I really got out of the experience (besides some serious college deja vu!) was a useful overview of what’s going on in the world of digital editing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omeka for Textual Scholars.&lt;/strong&gt; The first stop was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.textual.org&quot;&gt;Society for Textual Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; (STS) conference in Austin, Texas, which while not purely a digital conference necessarily gravitated toward discussions of digital tools. I began the conference by teaching a workshop, “Zero to Archive in Sixty Seconds: An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omeka.org&quot;&gt;Omeka&lt;/a&gt; Workshop for Textual Scholars” (teaching tools from the workshop are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/workshops/sts12.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Omeka is a powerful platform for creating digital museums--and if you’re interested in a non-traditional sort of digital literary edition, one that situates a text or texts in a rich discourse field of media related to its creation and reception, Omeka helps you realize a narrative out of an archive of interlinked media. There’s also growing work on plugins specific to creating a more traditional type of edition within Omeka, such as Scripto (transcription crowdsourcing), TEIDisplay plus SolrSearch (displays TEI files and makes them phrase-searchable), and the TEI Boilerplate (another method of TEI display), all of which we explored during the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching “Thinking Like an Editor”.&lt;/strong&gt; Later at STS, I led a panel of editors from varied disciplinary backgrounds (theater performance, education, religion, Arabic language and translation, and digital edition design) in talking about ways to expose more people to “think like an editor”. Starting from Gary Taylor’s suggestion that the function of the editor is to help people get near texts and thereby love these cultural artifacts, we had a lively discussion about practical classroom assignments and digital tools for making our editions more participatory. One example of editing pedagogy we explored was MITH’s recent mentoring of graduate students in Neil Fraistat’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/category/spring-2012&quot;&gt;Technoromanticism&lt;/a&gt; course; by conceiving the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org&quot;&gt;Shelley-Godwin Archive&lt;/a&gt; as a teaching site, MITH was both able to bring students closer to a text they’d already come to care about (each student marked up ten pages of Mary Shelley’s &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; manuscript with TEI) as well as teach some practical digital skills and workflows (captured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://amandavisconti.github.io/markup-pedagogy&quot;&gt;this documentation&lt;/a&gt;). In addition to introducing students to “thinking like an editor” around texts to which they already have some emotional connection, we discussed tactics for bringing historical textual artifacts alive such as exploring marginalia for evidence of a writer’s habits and thinking, exposing students to the materiality of old texts, and using performance to teach making editing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Evolving Digital Editions Platform.&lt;/strong&gt; After STS, the next stop was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhsi.org&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Summer Institute&lt;/a&gt; (DHSI) in Victoria, British Columbia, where I took the Digital Editions course taught by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matthuculak.com&quot;&gt;Matt Huculak&lt;/a&gt;. This course explored the evolving &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editingmodernism.ca&quot;&gt;Editing Modernism in Canada&lt;/a&gt; project platform &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modernistcommons.ca&quot;&gt;Modernist Commons&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that offered an interesting counterpoint to the edition options available with Omeka. Modernist Commons is being developed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://islandora.ca&quot;&gt;Islandora&lt;/a&gt;, a hybrid of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drupal.org&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; CMS and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fedora-commons.org&quot;&gt;Fedora Commons&lt;/a&gt; repository system; to put it simply, it’s a WYSIWYG tool for creating complete digital editions. The platform includes an ingest and OCR transcription process, areas for both TEI and RDF markup, rectangular and polygonal image annotation, and a shared collection of entity information (i.e. so that naming and events marked in different editions point to the same idea). The tool supports a number of front-end layouts such as the Internet Archive viewer, which allows a book-like appearance with pages that flip as you read, and also allows for the inclusion of born-digital content such as editorial methodologies. EMiC Project Director &lt;a href=&quot;http://sinisterplots.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Dean Irvine&lt;/a&gt; described the goals for Modernist Commons as offering both a platform for enriching text meaningfully without necessarily requiring knowledge of TEI (e.g. using simple RDF relationship fields and image annotation) as well as, for more advanced users, a platform that is modular and allows for customization and mass production of a variety of editions. It was fascinating to play around with a tool that was still in development and discuss the choices actively shaping it with its developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DHSI and DH&lt;/strong&gt;. Beyond the Digital Editions course, DHSI was a powerful demonstration of just how many fascinating areas of knowledge the umbrella “Digital Humanities” covers. With seventeen courses covering everything from physical computing (e.g. 3d printers) to digital pedagogy to the pre-digital book, a common theme among attendees was how difficult it had been to decide on just one of those classes to take (in fact, many attendees come back year after year from across the country to take more of DHSI’s course offerings). I was also impressed with how much the Digital Humanities community benefits &lt;em&gt;socially&lt;/em&gt; from its allegiance to new technologies. Since everyone is always a novice when working with evolving tools, there’s extra impetus to help one another learn and generally geek and rejoice in the sharing of new knowledge and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STS and DHSI provided a lovely ten days of sharing knowledge about the future of digital editing, and I’m looking forward to repeating the DHSI experience at MITH in January, when we host the first Digital Humanities Winter Institute.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Mapping the Flow of Knowledge with "View DHQ": ACH Microgrant Award</title>
   <link href="/2012/04/19/ach-microgrant-award"/>
   <updated>2012-04-19T18:35:16-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/04/19/ach-microgrant-award</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am one of four winners of the 2012 &lt;a href=&quot;http://ach.org/2012/04/19/ach-announces-microgrants-winners&quot;&gt;Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) Microgrant&lt;/a&gt;s awards! ACH Microgrants reward enterprising ideas that serve the digital humanities community; read more about the awards &lt;a href=&quot;http://ach.org/2012/01/27/ach-microgrants&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or read on for info on my funded project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.5258509564762831&quot;&gt;The digital humanities movement is often conceived as a community of practice, with defined networks such as the &lt;em&gt;Digital Humanities Now&lt;/em&gt; Twitter list, &lt;em&gt;Digital Humanities Questions and Answers&lt;/em&gt; forum, and various journals acting as platforms for sub-genres of DH research. &lt;em&gt;Digital Humanities Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;, while a fairly recent journal, attracts more broadly relevant and interdisciplinary work than more focused fora such as &lt;em&gt;Digital Medievalist&lt;/em&gt;; this breadth makes &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; an excellent test case for tracking the flow of knowledge in the digital humanities via attention to the citation networks of its articles. Thisƒ application proposes a visualization of &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt;’s citation networks with an eye toward identifying key digital humanities texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DH is no stranger to citation network analysis. A 2009 &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; article, Neel Smith’s “Citation in Classical Studies”, argued for citations as “descriptive of the subject of study”: “citation is a form of ontology: how we cite the objects we study identifies and describes the material of our domain independently of any technology” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000028/000028.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Mapping of digital humanities articles across journals is not new (e.g. Salah, Leydesdorff, and Scharnhorst 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dh2010.cch.kcl.ac.uk/academic-programme/abstracts/papers/html/ab-673.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), but the focus of such research has been on exploring which journals include DH work, not which individual DH works are cited within journals. Citation network research that includes information sources other than journal articles is not yet widespread in the digital humanities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ACH Microgrant will support making the existing &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; citation content more visible and more easily analyzed through a visualization; the grant also allows MITH to provide code that could be used in future dynamic citation network visualization implementations. MITH Assistant Director Travis Brown assisted me in conducting preliminary investigations with &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt;’s citation data to ensure it is usable in my visualization tool of choice, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gephi.org&quot;&gt;Gephi&lt;/a&gt;. For an example of Gephi used in DH network analysis research, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhs.stanford.edu/dh/gephi/dhstanford2.html&quot;&gt;Elijah Meeks and Molly Wilson’s ongoing work using Gephi &lt;/a&gt;to visualize self-reported digital humanities affiliation at Stanford; my final visualization should combine the visual appeal of Meeks and Wilson’s work with an easy way to drill down and view the individual works and citations involved in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key issue in my work will be the current size of the &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; dataset (110 articles), a small amount of articles from which to draw conclusions. However, my visualization work remains useful because my focus is on mapping connections, not asserting significant authority for any individual author or work. Also, my visualization process can provide a foundation for ongoing citation network visualizations as &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final deliverables will be one or more visual files of the citation network visualizations, the code used to capture and clean the citation data for visualization, and a final report. The final report will both technical and conceptual, documenting my scraping and visualizing process and addressing future paths for network analysis with DHQ’s citation data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibilities for future work include exploring the bibliographic details of what is cited (e.g. publishing format and venue, academic discipline and job title of author) as well as analyzing which academic fields are under-represented and which formats are mentioned within articles but not cited (as is sometimes the case with digital archives and academic blog posts). Linearity (who cites whom) and time elapsed between publication and citation are other interesting places for visualization and analysis. Additionally, I may be able to visualize a meaningful subset of &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; articles citing other &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; articles as the &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; dataset grows. As I explore these possibilities for more detailed visualizations, I will articulate their proposed interpretations, keeping my emphasis on network exploration rather than asserting authority for any individual works or authors. The outcome of this work should stretch beyond these deliverables by offering &lt;em&gt;DHQ&lt;/em&gt; a basis on which to eventually create a dynamically updated citation network visualization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>“How Can You Love a Work If You Don't Know It?”: Six Lessons on Digital Editing from Team MARKUP</title>
   <link href="/2012/04/19/how-can-you-love-a-work-if-you-dont-know-it-six-lessons-from-team-markup"/>
   <updated>2012-04-19T04:19:49-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/04/19/how-can-you-love-a-work-if-you-dont-know-it-six-lessons-from-team-markup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team MARKUP evolved as a group project in Neil Fraistat&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/category/spring-2012&quot;&gt;Technoromanticism graduate seminar&lt;/a&gt; (English 738T) during the Spring 2012 term at the University of Maryland; our team was augmented by several students in &lt;a href=&quot;http://digital19thcentury.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;the sister course&lt;/a&gt; taught by Andrew Stauffer at the University of Virginia. The project involved using git and GitHub to manage a collaborative encoding project, practicing TEI and the use of the Oxygen XML editor for markup and validation, and encoding and quality-control checking nearly 100 pages of Mary Shelley&#39;s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; manuscript for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org&quot;&gt;Shelley-Godwin Archive&lt;/a&gt; (each UMD student encoded ten pages, while the UVa students divided a ten-page chunk among themselves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team MARKUP wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/team-markup-encoding-frankenstein-for-the-shelley-godwin-archive-2&quot;&gt;a collaborative post&lt;/a&gt; covering the different phases of the project in detail, so I’ll use this post to concentrate on some specifics of my personal experience with the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Six takeaways from the Team MARKUP project:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affective editing is effective editing?&lt;/strong&gt; One of my favorite quotations--so beloved that it shapes my professional work and has been reused shamelessly on my Ph.D. exams list, a Society for Textual Scholarship &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/02/17/society-for-textual-scholarship-panel-abstract&quot;&gt;panel abstract&lt;/a&gt;, and at least one paper--is Gary Taylor’s reasoning on the meaningfulness of editing: “How can you love a work, if you don&#39;t know it? How can you know it, if you can&#39;t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?”*. Encoding my editorial decisions with TEI pushed me a step closer to the text than my previous non-encoded editorial experience, something I didn’t know was possible.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of TEI for first page of volume ii of Frankenstein&quot; src=&quot;/assets/TEIexample.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;122&quot;&gt;The Creature speaks! TEI for the first page of the Creature&#39;s monologue in Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ten pages happened to be the first pages of the Creature’s monologue; hearing the voice of the Creature by seeing its true creator’s (Mary Shelley’s) handwriting gave me shivers--meaningful shivers accompanied by a greater understanding of important aspects of Shelley’s writing, such as the large editorial impact made by her husband Percy and the differing ways she crossed out or emphasized changes to her draft. Moving between the manuscripts images and the TEI encoding--so similar to my other work as a web designer and developer--also emphasized the differences in the writing process of my generation and the work that went into inscribing, organizing, and editing a book without the aid of a mechanical or digital device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project management.&lt;/strong&gt; Because we didn’t know what to expect from the project until we were in the thick of encoding--would everyone be able to correctly encode ten full pages? how would we control quality across our work? what would our finished pages look like in terms of encoding depth?--we spent most of the project functioning as a large team, which was both sometimes as unwieldy as our large GoogleDoc (trying to find a time when eight busy graduate students can meet outside of class time is difficult!) and sometimes made sense (I was one of the few people on our team comfortable with GitHub and encoding at the start of the project, so I helped with a lot of one-on-one Skype, in-person, and email sessions early on). If I did the project over, I would have held a single Bootcamp day where we all installed and pushed within GitHub and encoded one page of manuscript up on the projector screen, then delegated my role as team organizer by dividing us into three subgroups. I also might have insisted on people agreeing ahead of time on being available for specific in-person meeting times, rather than trying to schedule these one or two weeks beforehand. I do think things worked out pretty well as they did, largely because we had such a great team. Having the GoogleDoc (discussed more below) as a central point for tech how-tos, advice, and questions was also a good choice, though in a larger project I’d probably explore a multi-page option such as a wiki so that information was a) easier to navigate and b) easily made public at the end of our project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing schemas and encoding as interpretive.&lt;/strong&gt; Encoders who started their work early realized that their efforts had good and bad results: because the schema saw frequent updates during our work, those who finished fast needed to repeatedly update their encoding (e.g. a major change was removing the use of &lt;mod type&gt;s). Of course it was frustrating to need to update work we thought was finished--but this was also a great lesson about work with a real digital edition. Not only did the schema changes get across that the schema was a dynamic response to the evolving methodology of the archive, it prepared us for work as encoders outside of a classroom assignment. Finally, seeing the schema as a dynamic entity up for discussion emphasized that even among more seasoned encoders, there are many ways to encode the same issue: encoding, as with all editing, is ultimately interpretative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encode all the things! Or not.&lt;/strong&gt;Depth of encoding was a difficult issue to understand early on; once we’d encoded a few pages, I began to have a better sense of what required encoding and what aspects of the manuscript images I could ignore. Initially, I was driven to encode everything, to model what I saw as thoroughly as possible: sums in the margins, different types of overstrikes, and analytical bibliography aspects such as smudges and burns and creases.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;x all the y meme stating encode all the things!&quot; src=&quot;/assets/encode-300x215.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;215&quot;&gt;Encode all the things... or not. Remixed from image by Allie Brosh of Hyperbole (hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What helped me begin to judge what to encode was understanding what was useful for Team MARKUP to encode (the basics that would apply to future encoding work: page structure and additions and deletions), what was useful for more advanced encoders to tackle (sitting in on the SGA staff meetings, I knew that some of our work would be subject to find-and-replace by people more experienced with Percy and Mary’s handwriting styles), and what our final audience would do with our XML (e.g. smudges and burns weren’t important, but Percy’s doodles could indicate an editorial state of mind useful to the literary scholar).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editorial pedagogy.&lt;/strong&gt; Working on Team MARKUP not only improved my markup skills, it also gave me more experience with teaching various skills related to editions. As I mentioned above, acting as organizer and de facto tech person for the team gave me a chance to write up some documentation on using GitHub and Oxygen for encoding work. I’m developing this content for &lt;a href=&quot;https://amandavisconti.github.io/markup-pedagogy&quot;&gt;this set of GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; to help other new encoders work with the Shelley-Godwin Archive and other encoding projects. Happily, I was already scheduled to talk about editorial pedagogy at two conferences right after this seminar ends; the Team MARKUP experience will definitely become part of my talks during &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/02/17/society-for-textual-scholarship-panel-abstract&quot;&gt;a panel&lt;/a&gt; I organized on embedding editorial pedagogy in editions (Society for Textual Scholarship conference).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideas for future encoding work.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve started to think about ways to encode Frankenstein more deeply; this thinking has taken the form of considering tags that would let me ask questions about the thematics of the manuscript using Python or &lt;a href=&quot;http://voyeurtools.org/tool/Links&quot;&gt;TextVoyeur&lt;/a&gt; (aka Voyant); I’m also interested in markup that deals with the analytical bibliography aspects of the text, but need to spend more time with the rest of the manuscript images before I think about those. So far, I’ve come up with five new thematic tagging areas I might explore:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitudes toward monstrosity:&lt;/strong&gt; A tag that would identify the constellation of related words (monster, monstrous, monstrosity), any mentions of mythical supernatural creatures, metaphorical references to monstrosity (e.g. “his vampiric behavior sucks the energy out of you”), and reactions/attitudes toward the monstrous (with attributes differentiating responses to confronting monstrosity with positive, negative, and neutral attitudes). I could then track these variables as they appear across the novel and look for patterns (e.g. do we see less metaphorical references to monstrosity once a “real” monster is more prevalent in the plot?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking about doodles:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re currently marking marginalia doodles with &lt;figure&gt; and a &lt;desc&gt; tag describing the drawing. In our section of the manuscript, many (all?) of these doodles are Percy Shelley’s; I’d like to expand this tag to let me identify and sort these doodles by variables such as complexity (how much thought went into them rather than editing the adjacent text?), sense (do they illustrate the adjacent text?), and commentary (as an extension of sense tagging, does a doodle seem ironically comic given the seriousness or tragedy of the adjacent text?). For someone new to studying Percy’s editorial role, such tagging would help me understand both his editing process and his attitude toward Mary’s writing (reverent? patronizing? distracted? meditative?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Names, dates, places:&lt;/strong&gt; These tags would let us create an animated timeline of the novel that shows major characters as they move across a map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anatomy, whole and in part:&lt;/strong&gt; To quote from an idea raised in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/useful-prosthetics-pretty-metaphors-and-more-on-dh-tools&quot;&gt;an earlier post&lt;/a&gt; of mine, I’d add tags that allowed “tracking the incidence of references to different body parts–face, arms, eyes–throughout Frankenstein, and trying to make sense of how these different terms were distributed throughout the novel. In a book concerned with the manufacture of bodies, would a distant reading show us that the placement of references to parts of the body reflected any deeper meanings, e.g. might we see more references to certain areas of the body grouped in areas of the novel with corresponding emphases on the display, observation, and action? A correlation in the frequency and placement of anatomical terms with Frankenstein‘s narrative structure felt unlikely (so unlikely that I haven’t run my test yet, and I’m not saving the idea for a paper!), but if had been lurking in Shelley’s writing choices, TextVoyeur would have made such a technique more visible.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative frames:&lt;/strong&gt; Tags that identified both the specifics of a current frame (who is the speaker, who is their audience, where are they, how removed in time are they from the events they narrate?) and that frame’s relationship to other frames in the novel (should we be thinking of these words as both narrated by Walton and edited by Victor?) would help create a visualization of the novel’s structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect that playing around with such tags and a distant reading tool would yield even better thinking about encoding methodology than the structural encoding I’ve been working on so far, as the decisions on when to use these tags would be so much more subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Useful prosthetics, pretty metaphors? (and more on DH tools)</title>
   <link href="/2012/04/12/useful-prosthetics-pretty-metaphors-and-more-on-dh-tools"/>
   <updated>2012-04-12T01:09:59-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/04/12/useful-prosthetics-pretty-metaphors-and-more-on-dh-tools</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Cross-posted from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/useful-prosthetics-pretty-metaphors-and-more-on-dh-tools&quot;&gt;Technoromanticism seminar blog&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blason1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;408&quot; height=&quot;580&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Metaphors will be called home for good. There will be no more likeness, only identity.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Shelley Jackson, &lt;em&gt;Patchwork Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some interrelated thoughts on cyborgs/metaphors/prosthetics. &lt;/strong&gt;Shelley Jackson&#39;s Patchwork Girl quotes Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnet 130 (“my mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun”), bringing into a work already quite aware of the mimicries between body and text the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blason&quot;&gt;blason&lt;/a&gt;, the style of poetry that praises but pieces individual pieces of the loved one&#39;s anatomy through metaphor (&quot;she goes on&quot;). Ever since I encountered the etching above, with its parodic response to such blason conceits as eyes like suns darting rays, cheeks like roses, and teeth like pearls, I&#39;ve been unable to read that form of poetry as intended (i.e. describing a harmonious whole); the etching questions whether we can fashion the ideal from constituent ideals. Victor Frankenstein describes his Creature as an almost-functional blason figure (&quot;I had selected his features as beautiful&quot;), but precedes this claim by admitting another qualifier on his choices for materials: &quot;His limbs were in proportion&quot;. As with the etching, the Creature&#39;s monstrosity comes partly from the failure of these parts, beautiful and proportionate as they may be, to coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about extending these questions of the harmony and juxtaposition of parts of a whole (text/body) to prosthetics, whether these prosthetics are more metaphorical (e.g. prosthetics of memory) or physical additions like our cyborg mobile devices. When my group was developing a Cyborg&#39;s Definition of &quot;Women&quot;, we identified &quot;that species&quot; as a group that faced extinction after failing to make use of certain prosthetics/tools; for Wollestonecraft, the tool in question was education. Success through the use of prosthetics was a mark of cyborghood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the addition of prosthetics, we&#39;re facing (as with blason) the juxtaposition of disparate parts--except in this case, the metaphors by which we&#39;re extending our bodies aren&#39;t pulling us apart into unbalanced monsters. Certainly they can go either way, but I&#39;m seeing a pattern where metaphors applied onto figures can create monsters like the one in the etching, and metaphors growing out of or chosen by a figure have greater harmony and utility. Perhaps prosthetics are a way of marking these piece-making bodily metaphors not as even more-idealized (and thus less utilizable?) objects, but as tools defined by their individual uses and qualities? I&#39;d be interested in listing and comparing the Creature&#39;s bodily parts with the Patchwork Girl&#39;s; given their gender difference, it&#39;s interesting to see the Creature&#39;s parts as typical of blason inutility (lustrous black hair!) while the Patchwork Girl&#39;s parts are defined (sometimes indirectly via anecdote) by their abilities to dance, dissemble, act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DH Tools. &lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;d intended to write my next &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T&quot;&gt;Technoromanticism seminar blog&lt;/a&gt; post as a follow-up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/digitally-dissecting-the-anatomy-of-frankenstein-part-one&quot;&gt;my discussion of DH tools&lt;/a&gt;, using a few of these tools to ask questions about &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; while pointing out the limits and specifics of what the digital tools&#39; answers actually say. I didn&#39;t get around to that... but I thought I&#39;d share some tips for distant reading work I&#39;ve used with my English 295 students:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for outliers. Is there anything in the visualization that doesn’t look the way you expected? Or, if everything looks the way you expected, what does that say about the text?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you imagine a visualization of the text that you’d like to make, but can’t find an appropriate tool to do so? Describe this imagined tool and what you would expect to discover about your text with it. Why do you think such a tool doesn’t exist yet? What would a computer need to be able to do--and if computers would need to do something &quot;more human&quot; than they can now, can you think of a way to train a computer to achieve that? (Think about topic modeling and sentiment analysis.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s okay to ask questions with no previous expectations, questions based on hunches of what you might see, or questions where you there&#39;s a tiny possibility of an interesting result, but you want to check for it anyway. When I was thinking about demoing how to work with the TextVoyeur tool, for example, I was planning on tracking the incidence of references to different body parts--face, arms, eyes--throughout &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, and trying to make sense of how these different terms were distributed throughout the novel. In a book concerned with the manufacture of bodies, would a distant reading&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;show us that the placement of references to parts of the body reflected any deeper meanings, e.g. might we see more references to certain areas of the body grouped in areas of the novel with corresponding emphases on the display, observation, and action? A correlation in the frequency and placement of anatomical terms with &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s narrative structure felt unlikely (so unlikely that I haven&#39;t run my test yet, and I&#39;m not saving the idea for a paper!), but if had been lurking in Shelley&#39;s writing choices, TextVoyeur would have made such a technique more visible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Think carefully about what a visualization means. For example, I wanted to make a visualization of Charles Dickens’ &lt;em&gt;David Copperfield&lt;/em&gt;; the protagonist is given a name change about halfway through the novel, and I wanted to track what other changes co-occured with this name change and see whether there was a pattern in the characters who used the new name over those who stuck with the old name. This problem is a great candidate for a graph showing name frequency (“David”, the old name, versus “Trotwood”, the new name). Using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://voyeurtools.org&quot;&gt;TextVoyeur&lt;/a&gt; tool, I was able to quickly create graphs of when the two names occurred through the novel:&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/david.png&quot; width=&quot;518&quot; height=&quot;317&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/trotwood.png&quot; width=&quot;556&quot; height=&quot;340&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(Note that TextVoyeur lets you overlay multiple word frequency graphs, something I didn&#39;t realize a year ago when I made these images. I&#39;d have run a new graph for this post, but both instances of TextVoyeur/Voyant have been non-functional for the past two days... so be aware that the y-axes are slightly different in the two graphs... also that TextVoyeur is a fantastic tool, but sometimes unavailable when you&#39;re hoping to use it.)&lt;/em&gt; There are issues, of course, with just accepting a visualization made by dropping the text into a distant reading tool. “David” was both the protagonist’s name and the name of his father; some characters used nicknames for David instead of his given name, etc.: these issues meant that I needed to be careful about what I could claim when reading a visualization of the protagonist’s naming. If I were marking up a transcription of &lt;em&gt;David Copperfield&lt;/em&gt; for use in a project concerned with questions of naming and appellation, I&#39;d want to consider tags that let me search for and count names by their speaker, meaning (is a diminutive used lovingly or condescendingly?), and other nuances. I&#39;d also want to read the data I&#39;m focusing on against other, similar data; for example, do other names (e.g. Betsy, Agnes) also occur less frequently in the second half of the book, perhaps because of changes in the monologue style or the physical location of the protagonist? A distant reading visualization should always be accompanied by a careful description of what it does and doesn&#39;t show.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Ulysses the Video Game and Anachronistic Linati Schema!</title>
   <link href="/2012/02/20/anachronistic-linati-schema"/>
   <updated>2012-02-20T04:53:15-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/02/20/anachronistic-linati-schema</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;James Joyce with Wii&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/joycewii.jpg&quot; width=&quot;274&quot; height=&quot;293&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Schneider presented an fun thought experiment on his blog* about a year ago: if someone created a &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; video game, what technics would we use to parallel the style peculiar to each section of the novel? For Proetus, Matt proposed &quot;First Person Stream-of-consciousness, akin to that seen in Stout Games&#39; IGF nominated &lt;em&gt;Dinner Date&lt;/em&gt;&quot;; for Ithaca, a &quot;catechism based on Joseph Weizenbaum&#39;s classic ELIZA&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; nerd and both a game and textual studies scholar, so I had to jump into the thought experiment. The following are the ideas I&#39;ve come up with (some of them I brainstormed during a &quot;Literary ARG&quot; session I led at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/13/session-proposal-maryland-is-for-gamers&quot;&gt;THATCamp Games&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemachus: &lt;em&gt;Pikmin.&lt;/em&gt; Has that &quot;the day is new&quot; feel, and perhaps you could parallel picking up strange new objects to picking up on Stephen&#39;s various preoccupations and annoyances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nestor: Some sort of annoying pedantic training sequence. Maybe a &lt;em&gt;Civ(3&lt;/em&gt;?) mod that models Ireland vs. England that forces you to sit through a frustratingly superior tutorial first?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lotus Eaters: Something that rewards you for lazier playing, like &lt;em&gt;Don&#39;t Shoot the Puppy&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sirens: Oh boy. A &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero/Rock Band&lt;/em&gt;/karaoke clone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclops: Model the Citizen on one of the colossi from &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nausicaa: ...Japanese dating sim?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circe: I think a light world/dark world mechanic like that used in &lt;em&gt;Link to the Past&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Trilby&#39;s Notes&lt;/em&gt; might work well towards emphasizing the real/unreal in Circe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ithaca: Matching questions and answers a la &lt;em&gt;Monkey Island&lt;/em&gt; insult duels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time to pull these back here form the comments on Matt&#39;s blog, because on Wednesday I&#39;ll be expanding on the idea with a &quot;Anachronistic Linati Schema&quot; lesson plan for teaching &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;ll be substitute-teaching for Professor Brian Richardson&#39;s English 428 undergraduate seminar on &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, and since we&#39;ll be discussing the &quot;Hades&quot; section (right before THE INELUCTABLE HEADLINES of Aeolus), we&#39;re at a good point to stand back and think about how the less-obvious style changes we&#39;ve encountered so far are both responding to and shaping the narrative. The plan is to share these videogame ideas, then have students choose a media category with which they&#39;re familiar (music, movies, books--or even better would be individual games within genres, or subgenres within genres). After putting these up on a grid together, we&#39;ll look for similarities among the choices. I&#39;ll report back on Wednesday with what we find!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Think Like an Editor: Five Disciplinary Approaches to Editing Pedagogy (Society for Textual Scholarship Panel Abstract)</title>
   <link href="/2012/02/17/society-for-textual-scholarship-panel-abstract"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1  id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.7137126891898768&quot;&gt;Think Like an Editor: Five Disciplinary Approaches to Editing Pedagogy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amanda Visconti, Panel Organizer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Department of English and Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, University of Maryland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew Blasenak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Department of Theatre, The Ohio State University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Susan C. Comilang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Department of English, Washington Adventist University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cass Morris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Department of Education, American Shakespeare Center&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dagmar A. Riedel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Center for Iranian Studies, Columbia University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scholarly editor Gary Taylor has asked: “How can you love a work, if you don&#39;t know it? How can you know it, if you can&#39;t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” This roundtable asks a fourth question: “If more editors are a good thing, how do we expose learners outside of graduate departments to the challenges and rewards of scholarly editing?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speakers explore approaches to editorial pedagogy from five diverse backgrounds—theater, education, religion, Arabic language and translation, and digital edition design. While the broad goal of this panel is discussing how different editorial genres suggest new paths for editing pedagogy, we propose a specific focus on how we might expose more readers to a love of editing through digital editions and editorial tools. Panelists will apply their expertise to discussing how we might craft online scholarly editions that help undergraduates and other readers without previous textual experience think like editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists Andrew Blasenak and Cass Morris translate the tools and techniques of early modern dramatic rehearsal into two approaches to theatrical editing pedagogy. Blasenak engages students with the craft of editing through rehearsal, where acting choices become available from a study of multiple texts and contextualizing information; he argues that editing requires the same imaginative engagement actors and dramaturges draw on in the rehearsal room. Morris approaches theatrical editing from a different angle, involving students with textual variants through the American Shakespeare Center’s program for undergraduates; she works with students rather than actors, and uses editing to teach rather than directly teaching editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Comilang brings expertise in editing religious texts meant for devotional use, an area of editing that serves both academic and meditative audiences. Dagmar Riedel, Assistant Editor for the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;/em&gt;, works with widely dispersed Islamic manuscripts existing in both the original and in English translation. Both Comilang and Riedel work on editions incorporating crowdsourcing; Comilang’s The Spiritual Exercises draws on readers for comment and discussion of her text’s contemplative practice, while Riedel’s work draws in commentators from outside the textual studies community through Flickr-hosted facsimiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Visconti applies participatory literary formats such as games and e-lit to designing participatory digital editions of modernist prose. Her “Choose Your Own Edition” project, a website that will let students work through different possible choices for moments of editorial choice within a text, attempts to both expose and scaffold the process of editorial decision-making to an undergraduate audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After grounding the debate in their own editing work, the speakers will engage questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does each of the speaker’s five disciplines bring to our knowledge about editing pedagogy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we extend editing pedagogy beyond “teaching to the choir” of graduate students already planning on becoming scholarly editors? Why might we want to reach diverse audiences such as undergraduates and readers with no academic intentions, and how could we accomplish such a task?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we extend editions to invite, provoke, and teach more diverse audiences of readers, how can the editorial community in turn gain from this enfranchised audience? How can we make crowdsourcing as meaningful for individual editions as it has been for digital archives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the possibilities and shortcomings of digital editions in terms of teaching editing? What specific features of digital editions might help us embed editorial pedagogies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel will be of interest to anyone with interests in editing pedagogy, editions from diverse traditions and genres, or editions meaningfully incorporating interactive and/or digital elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross-posted from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/thatcamp-games-maryland-is-for-gamers&quot;&gt;MITH&lt;/a&gt; blog. A list of post-conference write-ups, photos, twitter data, and more &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/25/data-data-data&quot;&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THATCamp Games, the late-January four-day unconference on digital humanities and gaming, had its origin in &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.flickr.com/photos/trevorandmarjee/5797536358&quot;&gt;a packed “humanities gaming” catch-all session&lt;/a&gt; at THATCamp Prime 2011, where we quickly realized that “games” was too broad a topic for a single session. THATCamp Games brought together members of the games industry, games researchers and designers, and games teachers to discuss games in as many genres (e.g. board games, alternate reality games, video games) and areas (e.g. games for teaching writing, game programming, and historical gaming) as possible. Almost one hundred people attended, coming from both the local DC/MD area and states across the country: Washington, California, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first event was one of the first screenings of Lorien Green’s new documentary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boardgamemovie.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Going Cardboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a documentary about the players and designers in the burgeoning eurogaming scene; after the film showing, Green answered questions via Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday offered a full day of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcampgames.org/bootcamps&quot;&gt;fifteen workshops&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;Bootcamps&quot;) divided into three tracks: beginner-friendly introductions to game design (e.g. a “my first board game” prototyping session), a “hack track” for people with some previous game coding experience (e.g. HTML5, Inform 7, and the Kinect), and a track devoted to games in the classroom (e.g. alternate reality games and video games in the classroom). After the workshops, we headed over to MITH (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ow.ly/i/qiU7&quot;&gt;avoiding the grue&lt;/a&gt;) for a reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday started off menacingly: an overnight snowstorm left sheets of black ice between attendees and the conference. Most of the attendees and all of the coffee managed to make it to the conference building on time, however, and we cast our votes to narrow down almost forty attendee-proposed sessions to fit into five time slots in five rooms. (If you’re not familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcamp.org&quot;&gt;THATCamps&lt;/a&gt;, attendees don’t present papers but instead write blog posts about topics they’d like to discuss, then facilitate sessions on those topics). You can see which sessions got placed on the schedule &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcampgames.org/fullchedule&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; these included discussions on &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/03/session-proposal-quest-based-evaluation-schemes&quot;&gt;quest-based evaluation schemes&lt;/a&gt;, teaching &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/20/session-proposal-games-and-the-literature-classroom&quot;&gt;games in the literature classroom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/03/a-modest-session-proposal&quot;&gt;course game design using learning management systems&lt;/a&gt;. We ran a game lounge all-day on Saturday, but since most attendees were busy with sessions then, we also met for game-playing and a Glorious-Trainwrecks-style rapid-prototyping game design jam on Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you weren’t following the overwhelming volume of “#thatcamp games” tweets at the end of last month, we’re happy to report that the event satisfied both unconference novices and THATCamp veterans, with assessments such as “a truly intellectually (and personally) meaningful event” and “THATCamp Games: totally awesome.&quot; Amidst the sessions, we ran an unconference-long alternate reality game, participated as a group in a spoken text adventure, logged onto an attendee-run Minecraft server, and thought really hard about the puzzle on the backs of the conference shirts. If you’re sad you missed the event, we’re collecting names of potential future attendees via a sidebar form on &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcampgames.org&quot;&gt;thatcampgames.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thatcampgames.org&quot;&gt;THATCamp Games&lt;/a&gt; was co-organized by MITH Webmaster &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;Amanda Visconti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://selfloud.net&quot;&gt;Anastasia Salter&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>Hack Books: Hack What?</title>
   <link href="/2012/01/26/hack-books-hack-what"/>
   <updated>2012-01-26T22:48:30-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2012/01/26/hack-books-hack-what</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross-posted from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/book-hacking-primer&quot;&gt;Technoromanticism Seminar Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent my bus ride home thinking about what it might mean to hack a book. I&#39;ve seen beautiful sculptures made out of books (like these: &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2011/12/23/guy-laramees-books.html&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2011/09/12/anonymous-paper-sculptures-in-scotlands-libraries.html&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2009/03/19/brian-dettmers-book-1.html&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2009/06/17/nicholas-galanins-bo.html&quot;&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;) as well as more readable, but still fundamentally remixing acts of book hacking in the form of &quot;altered books&quot; like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humument&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Humument&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Jonathan Safran Froer&#39;s deliberately altered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gearfuse.com/hacking-the-app-called-the-book&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tree of Codes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even more than book art, however, thinking about designing digital editions of paper books has helped me start noticing the individual mechanics of the vehicle, and it feels like outlining just what a book &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; is a good step toward making it do things it &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; (i.e. hacking). Although we&#39;re not talking about digital literature yet, it could be useful to contrast books on-screen and off if we want to start pointing to what makes a book work (or, you can check out this &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdkucf6wxU4&quot;&gt;Medieval Help Desk&lt;/a&gt;&quot; video and think about the happy differences between scroll and book!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Kirschenbaum&#39;s article “&lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/bookscapes.pdf&quot;&gt;Bookscapes: Modeling Books in Electronic Space&lt;/a&gt;”* argues that contrasting books with their on-screen counterparts helps us call out the specific features important to the analog form because &quot;books on the screen are not books, they are models of books&quot;--and a model is made to be hacked and analyzed. Matt&#39;s article offers a nice starting point for thinking about the features of books, identifying five affordances specific to the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simultaneous random access and sequential ordering,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volumetric (three-dimensional) storage space,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finity/boundedness,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the comparative possibilities offered by two facing pages (think of Folger student Shakespeare editions), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writeability (who hasn&#39;t wished they could jot down notes on the PDF they&#39;re reading online?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look at how Blake hacks the book, can we add to Matt&#39;s list of book affordances? In addition to broad characteristics, we might list specific elements such as the datedness of page numbering on the Nook or the (un?)necessary pause when &quot;flipping&quot; pages on a Kindle. Why were these technologies useful in books, and awkward (or nostalgic) in e-books?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Digital Dos Passos</title>
   <link href="/2011/01/12/digital-dos-passos"/>
   <updated>2011-01-12T06:36:52-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/01/12/digital-dos-passos</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month, I released the first version of a new digital text project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitaldospassos.com&quot;&gt;Digital Dos Passos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Dos Passos&#39; &lt;em&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt; trilogy is a text particularly ripe for a digital treatment. No other work combines so many references to media with so little interpretive framing of this media (in Sartre&#39;s words, “the style of a statement to the Press&quot;; 66). The &lt;em&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt; trilogy style is not only removed and declarative, but patchworked; when asked what sort of plan he had for &lt;em&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt; when he began writing it, Dos Passos replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was trying to develop... the idea of montage. I had tried it out in Manhattan Transfer—using pieces of popular songs. By the time it evolved into such compartments as the camera eye of the U.S.A. trilogy it served a useful function—which in that case was to distill my subjective feelings about the incidents and people described. My hope was to achieve the objective approach of a Fielding, or a Flaubert... In the biographies, in the newsreels, and even the narrative, I aimed at total objectivity by giving conflicting views—using the camera eye as a safety valve for my own subjective feelings. It made objectivity in the rest of the book much easier. &lt;/em&gt;(Sanders)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt; trilogy is thus a &quot;montage&quot; of media, of events, and of people. The novels combine the frequency of pop culture name-checking in Don DeLillo&#39;s &lt;em&gt;White Noise&lt;/em&gt; with a popular consciousness long gone from living readers; the datedness of &lt;em&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s setting complicates an analog reading, but eases a digital presentation by placing most of its references in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.DigitalDosPassos.com&quot;&gt;Digital Dos Passos&lt;/a&gt; digital text is a site offering immersive engagement with the &lt;em&gt;U.S.A&lt;/em&gt;. trilogy&#39;s media; photography, video, audio, digitized newspapers, and other historical &lt;img title=&quot;Digital Dos Passos&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the http://www.DigitalDosPassos.com website&quot; src=&quot;/assets/ddp.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;244&quot;&gt;media, as well as short textual annotations, will alert readers to the events and people to which Dos Passos&#39; media references point. I began my exploration of Dos Passos&#39; use of media with the Newsreels in the trilogy&#39;s middle novel, &lt;em&gt;1919&lt;/em&gt;. The Newsreels&#39; discrete references to the media vehicles of popular culture (conceivable as separate fragments or items) are free of both commentary and narrative framing, a characteristic making the Newsreels both the easiest section to annotate and (because of their lack of commentary) the section most in need of such a digital treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of what&#39;s next, I&#39;ll be spending the spring term focusing on design and theory: presenting papers and submitting articles on several aspects of the project (which is especially rich because of my trine interests in complex Modernist novels, hypertext theory, and web design), as well as improving the site&#39;s interface to make it a more immersive experience. I plan to resume adding content to the site this summer, possibly with the assistance of other interested graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a graduate research assistant working with THINKtransmedia.org community members &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/4&quot;&gt;Derek Hansen&lt;/a&gt; (PI), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/5&quot;&gt;Kari Kraus&lt;/a&gt; (PI), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/6&quot;&gt;Elisabeth Bonsignore&lt;/a&gt; on an NSF-funded study exploring the design and use of ARGs in educational contexts. The purpose of this research is to better understand how transmedia storytelling experiences can be used as novel educational activities. We&#39;re also trying to improve our understanding of how experts and novices create transmedia experiences and experience them, with a special emphasis on the use of mobile devices.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Our study falls roughly into three parts:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1. Expert Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Over the past year, we&#39;ve been interviewing experts in the area of ARG design and development, transmedia studies, and games and learning. Our previous interviewees include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/9&quot;&gt;Margeaux Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, a recent MLS grad from UMD who is now a science/reference librarian at the University of Florida; she spoke with us about her experiences designing an information literacy mission/quest as part of a larger university ARG (&quot;Humans vs. Zombies&quot;). We have also interviewed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=user/10&quot;&gt;Georgina Goodlander&lt;/a&gt;, Interpretive Programs Manager Smithsonian at the American Art Museum and one of the developers behind their very recent ARG &quot;Pheon&quot;. Margeaux and Georgina are also THINKtransmedia.org community members, so feel free to contact them with questions about their transmedia work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; as of 01/2011, we&#39;ve also interviewed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=content/interview-sean-stewart&quot;&gt;Sean Stewart&lt;/a&gt; (ARG-writer extraordinaire &lt;em&gt;of The Beast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ilovebees&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Last Call Poker&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Cathy&#39;s Book&lt;/em&gt; series, to name a few), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/146&quot;&gt;Drew Davidson&lt;/a&gt; (director of the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/145&quot;&gt;Heather Owings&lt;/a&gt; (librarian and developer of several ARGs for and with teens), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/144&quot;&gt;James Gee&lt;/a&gt; (games and education theorist and author of &lt;em&gt;What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Good Video Games + Good Learning&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;World without Oil&lt;/em&gt; designer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/142&quot;&gt;Ken Eklund&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinktransmedia.org/?q=node/141&quot;&gt;John Maccabee&lt;/a&gt; (novelist; designer of ARGs such as the Smithsonian&#39;s &quot;Ghosts of a Chance&quot;; and CEO at CityMystery, which specializes in building educational ARGs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Novice Designers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We&#39;ve created a pool of ARG game-design novices from one of Professor Hansen&#39;s graduate iSchool classes as well as members of the research team. This team of &quot;novice designers&quot; will create a transmedia lesson plan that includes a mini-puzzle, the best of which will be used in an actual ARG. This group will both help us populate are ARG and study how first-time game designers confront design tasks; we&#39;ll be documenting their work through interviews and design diary activities throughout the design process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. ARG Players&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We&#39;re developing an ARG (with the help of the novice design group) to run during spring 2011. This part of the study will look at the place of ARGs within education--by working with both middle-schoolers and undergrads, we hope to build on our understanding of how ARGs communicate and reinforce learning, especially the learning of information literacies such as information-finding and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Online Archives: The Deena Larsen Collection and Omeka</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Reposted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hastac.org/blogs/amanda-visconti/online-archives-deena-larsen-collection-and-omeka&quot;&gt;my HASTAC blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;The Deena Larsen Collection at MITH&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Deena Larsen Collection website at MITH&quot; src=&quot;/assets/dlcs.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;180&quot;&gt;The Deena Larsen Collection at MITH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) just released the web presence for its Deena Larsen Collection of early electronic literature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/larsen&quot;&gt;http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created this website as part of the IMLS-funded Digital Humanities Model Internship; besides touting the awesomeness of the collection (a shower curtain/analog website! early electronic literature built in Hypercard! Mac Classic upon Mac Classic!), I&#39;d like to mention the software I used to build the site. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omeka.org&quot;&gt;Omeka&lt;/a&gt; (created by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason, which also created the wonderful bibliographic tool Zotero...) is a CMS crafted specifically for use with any kind of collection, from archives and museums to course materials to cultural memory sites. Omeka offers a web interface for the non-tech-savvy, but is also infinitely customizable for those who know PHP. Check out their site if you&#39;re interested in building any kind of online artifact repository.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s MITH&#39;s official release on the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) is very pleased to announce the release of a new Web site showcasing the Deena Larsen Collection we house and maintain:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mith.umd.edu/larsen&quot; &gt;http://www.mith.umd.edu/larsen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deena Larsen, whose best-known works include the hypertexts Marble Springs and Samplers (both published by Eastgate Systems), has been active in the creative electronic writing community nearly since its inception in the early 1980s. She has also been a collector and de facto archivist for that community, amassing what she has described as electronic literature&#39;s &quot;Great Library of Alexandria.&quot; In May 2007 she gave MITH the extraordinary gift of her personal collection of early-era computers, software, and digital files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The collection includes not only Deena&#39;s own extensive literary output, but original and sometimes unpublished material by nearly every author in her circle, effectively making it a cross-section of electronic writing during its key formative years (roughly 1985-1995). The hardware in the collection consists of five Mac Classics, two Mac SEs, and a Mac Plus, and associated accessories; the physical media includes some 800 diskettes, as well as nearly 100 CD-ROMs and Zip disks. The collection also contains manuscripts, newspaper clippings, books, comics, manuals, notebooks, syllabi, catalogs, brochures, posters, conference proceedings, and ephemera. According to Matthew Kirschenbaum, Associate Director of MITH and Associate Professor of English at Maryland, &quot;The arrival of Deenas collection at MITH furnishes us with invaluable source material which will further our in-house research in digital curation and preservation, as well as function as a unique resource for the growing number of researchers interested in early hypertext and electronic literature.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The site, built with Omeka, was designed by Amanda Visconti of the University of Michigan under the auspicices of the IMLS-funded Digital Humanities Model Internship program, which places iSchool students in working digital humanities centers. Kari Kraus, director of the program and Assistant Professor in Maryland&#39;s iSchool and English department, comments: &quot;Amanda&#39;s work is a great example of the kind of collaboration and mutual exchange we&#39;re working to promote.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
