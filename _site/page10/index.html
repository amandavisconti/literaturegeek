    <p>Digital humanist <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_bot" >Scott Weingart</a>'s website includes <a href="http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?page_id=3086" >a "pledges" page</a> that records his definition of being a good scholarly citizen: committing to open access and open source all the time, reducing barriers to participation in and extension of his scholarly work. This is an awesome idea: publicly recording what's important to you helps regularly check that you're acting in a way that accords with your values, and not just when it's convenient (If more scholars did this, we could look at word and topic frequencies and compare individuals' values to what we perceive as the values of the DH community as a whole). For example, if accessibility is important to me, I need to make certain that value is reflected in my current work, and I need to educate or reject participation in venues (conferences, projects) that don't care about accessibility.</p>
<p>I spend most of my scholarly time at present on dissertational work—web development, design, and blogging—so I want to record my values in relation to these activities. These values come across clearly in my dissertational blogging, with statements</p>
<ul>
<li>On a public, participatory humanities: "I intend to build tools and digital editions that help everyone—textual scholars and the lay person—participate in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning... a more public textual studies—a textual studies that encourages participation outside of a limited circle of expertise" (<a title="Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design & the Urgency of the Public Humanities" href="/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities" >here</a>)</li>
<li>On reifying and testing our theories about digital objects: "We need to build these [textual] theories into our digital editions such that their innovative arguments are... empirically testable via user studies" (<a title="Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design & the Urgency of the Public Humanities" href="/2013/04/11/dhdisspublichumanities" >here</a>)</li>
<li>On allowing your work to be extended and reused: "I’ll be releasing this project’s code (Drupal modules, themes) on GitHub so that anyone can reuse or modify my work in their own digital edition." (<a title="Infinite Ulysses: Project Precedents and Caveats" href="/2013/06/27/infinite-ulysses-background" >here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As I'm building my dissertation projects to assess textual theories, <strong>I need to actively check that what I build not only reflects the values I blog about, but non-verbally demonstrates them</strong>. Below, I've listed these various values in one place and tried to identify where in my dissertational projects they will be reified (I'm sure I'll forget something important to me that has become a tacit part of how I work—looking forward to that inevitable discovery after posting this!):</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<p><strong>1. Accessibility = universal design.</strong> As much as possible, design for all readers; build on existing work on usability and accessibility to create better DH-specific accessibility tutorials and standards. Library website accessibility and usability work is a fruitful place for research, as the structure and use of library websites is similar to that of a complex digital scholarly edition.</p>
<p><strong>2. A public humanities</strong>. Teaching is knowing; you should be able to explain your work to a non-specialist audience (without forgetting there's no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road#A_metaphorical_.E2.80.9CRoyal_Road.E2.80.9D_in_famous_quotations" >royal road</a> to geometry, of course! ("It is too bad that [the language for explaining mathematics] has to be mathematics, and that mathematics is hard for some people. It is reputed - I do not know if it is true - that when one of the kings was trying to learn geometry from Euclid he complained that it was difficult. And Euclid said, "There is no royal road to geometry". And there is no royal road. Physicists cannot make a conversion to any other language. If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in." —Richard Feynman) ). While using speculative experiments is a key methodology for at least the <em>Infinite Ulysses</em> portion of my dissertation (what happens if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?), I also want these experiments to produce deliverables useful here and now (a participatory edition for reading and discussing <em>Ulysses</em>).</p>
<p><strong>3. A public humanities is a participatory humanities.</strong> Our work is to preserve human culture, and preservation = propagation (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-A-Novel/dp/0307887448" ><em>Ready Player One</em></a>). Communication of our nerdy passions should be a two-way conversation, with the new questions and thoughts from readers outside our field or the academy brought into the great conversation. User-testing incorporates audience participation into the design as well as the final use of a project, but the digital humanities has been slow to establish best practices for <a title="DH Evaluation: A Four-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work" href="/2012/10/31/3partdheval" >DH-specific user-testing</a>. I hope to help make user-testing easier to include in a grant timeline by exploring and consolidating best practices.</p>
<p><strong>4. Scholarly design and development.</strong> Interface is argument: a critical act both to create and read. Building is scholarship, and while I don't believe that many works of built scholarship require replication in text to stand as intellectual contributions to the community, some sort of narrative of the methods and experience of creating the work is important to its reception and usage, and to reach a wider, non-technical community, that often means a written narrative. The benefits of reaching a wider audience by replicating your built scholarly work in an article or monograph aren't as important as getting that work done, though—so we need to advocate for student projects and dissertations to be accepted in forms other than the monograph, because the common requirement of doubling one's built scholarship with a monograph spreads a chilling effect on young scholars' interest in trying design, coding, and other digital or non-monograph-form scholarly work.</p>
<p><strong>5. Design is not pre-critical.</strong> When I consider an edition and what information it's trying to express, I've moved from thinking about the narrative content of a piece of literature to aspects such as its interpretations and reception history—those features the scholarly editor foregrounds in their textual notes and methodology, aspects which a well-designed interface can support or augment. This information-centered approach requires thinking about your audience and your goals for the use of your scholarly product. What we see when we encounter an edition shapes the questions we raise, the biases we inherit, and the things we end up knowing; as <a href="http://journals.tdl.org/paj/index.php/paj/article/view/8" >Jon Saklofske asks</a> during his reimagining of the Blake Archive interface: what are the interpretive resonances of redesign? (Saklofske, Jon. "NewRadial: Revisualizing the Blake Archive". <em>Poetess Archive Journal</em> 2.1 (December 2010).)</p>
<p><strong>6. Accurate semantics for situating what we do.</strong> Be as sensitive to how I construct non-digital or non-making scholarly work as I am to how scholarly building is often treated (e.g. "developers aren't scholars, or at least not when they're coding/designing"). I want to be wary of characterizing anything as "traditional work" or "non-digital"; these terms are too wide and abstract, carry connotations of datedness, and, most importantly—digital work IS traditional in the sense of following a tradition of practice (as with creating and designing editions in textual theory, or as with algorithmic criticism pre-computer, as Steve Ramsay shows in <a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/75tms2pw9780252036415.html" ><em>Reading Machines</em></a>). Building and design experiments have a long history as part of the textual scholar's intellectual toolkit; it isn’t whether something is written, or can be described linguistically, that determines whether critical thought went into it and scholarly utility comes out of it: it’s the appropriateness of the form to the argument, and the availability of that argument to discussion and evaluation in the scholarly community.</p>
<p><strong>7. Documentation.</strong> Part of accessibility and participatory design is making your technical and design decisions/methodology understandable to people not versed in the skills you employed. Good documentation can be a fairly simple by-product of good technical practice; for example, I basically produced a guide to creating your own Islandora digital edition site just by recording all my attempts, failures, and successes as I set up my own site (with the additional benefit that I could remember what I had already tried and places I might need to go back and alter).</p>
<p><strong>8. Open source, open access: clone my work and read it too.</strong> Here's a simpler way of putting it: your documentation should be so good that someone willing to put in the time and technical learning could hypothetically replicate your exact work completely (e.g. I'm hoping to make it clear how to "make your own Infinite Ulysses site") and more probably, create their own intellectual argument using the tools and scholarly form you documented. All code should be distributed with some license allowing at least free, non-commercial reuse (and although Creative Commons licenses aren't appropriate for code meant to be run, <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by/" >Bethany Nowviskie's argument</a> for not keeping a non-commercial requirement on your work is pretty convincing). As a corollary to making my code reusable and understandable, when I do get around to publishing about my dissertation via journal articles or other peer-reviewed platforms, it's important that I retain rights to the content allowing me to make it freely available to anyone to access.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<h2>Values Reified</h2>
<p>I should also write a set of blog posts exploring how each value ends up functioning as part of my dissertation and what difficulties (if any) impeded the value's inclusion (I'll come back and link each of the listed values to the posts as they are written).</p>
<p>Have you written something explaining your scholarly values? Add it to <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/JFJE65BA" >the "Values" folder in the Digital Humanities Zotero library</a> and we can look at word and topic frequencies in digital humanist values!</p>

    <p>If you're interested in learning more about information visualization by trying out some yourself, here's a quick tutorial on how to get a very basic dataset showing character relationships from a piece of literature into Gephi!</p>
<p>You might also check out my posts on the Bloomsday Ulysses visualization project (this year's <a title="“Suppose there’s some connection”: Visualizing Character Interactions in Ulysses for Bloomsday 2013" href="/2013/09/09/bloomsday2013results" >more in-depth analysis</a>, last year's <a title="O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)" href="/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis" >smaller project</a>), Gephi tutorials (<a title="View DHQ: Visualizing Data from Digital Humanities Quarterly (Part I of II)" href="/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt1">how I used Gephi</a> for my <a title="Mapping the Flow of Knowledge with “View DHQ”: ACH Microgrant Award" href="/2012/04/19/ach-microgrant-award" >"View DHQ"</a> DH knowledge networks project, <a title="View DHQ: Getting Started with Gephi for DH Vis (Part II of II)" href="/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt2">Gephi terminology and ideas for exploration</a>), and <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/" >ACH Microgrant visualization work</a>.</p>
<h3>Basic Gephi Dataset Creation</h3>
<p>In the Bloomsday project, we recorded data about what character interacted with which other characters, and used a scale of 1-7 to indicate the perceived intimacy of those interactions (e.g. from one person thinking of another person, to an involved conversation between two people).</p>
<p>For this kind of network of pairs of interacting people, the most basic relationship dataset would look like two columns on a spreadsheet, with each row containing names of two people in a relationship pair (e.g. John thought about Jim, Washington talked to Jefferson). If you're showing an equal relationship (John and Jim are paired because they had a conversation), the order of who gets placed in which of the two columns doesn't matter; if the relationship does have a direction (John sent a letter to Jim), you can think of these two columns as the "source" and "target" (the name at the start of an arrow, and the name an arrow is pointing at, like John -> Jim).</p>
<p>Here's an example of these two columns in the Bloomsday visualization dataset:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/2col.jpg"></p>
<p>To have a slightly more nuanced visualization, you can add a column to "weight" the edge (the connecting line or arrow between two "nodes"; it's like lines and dots--edges and nodes): assign some number that "weights" the kind of relationship the source and target in each row had. For example, maybe you want to rate the impact relationships had on West's work, with a 1 being least impact and a 3 being most. You now can have a spreadsheet that could look like:</p>
<p>Source          Target          Weight<br>
John              Jim              2<br>
John              Jane            1<br>
Jane              Jim              2</p>
<p>Here's an example of the three columns used in the Bloomsday visualization:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/3col.jpg"></p>
<p>We used the following codes in that dataset (but <a title="“Suppose there’s some connection”: Visualizing Character Interactions in Ulysses for Bloomsday 2013" href="/2013/09/09/bloomsday2013results">as I discuss in my post</a> on the resulting visualizations, such coding is highly subjective and definitely be improved/made less ambiguous):</p>
<table  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<colgroup>
<col width="509">
<col width="282"></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Coding for "Depth" of Character Interaction</strong></td>
<td><strong>Code to Use in Type of Interaction Column</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Character thinking of another character</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Character observing another character</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Omniscient third person narrator (for when two people interact, but it isn't from just one of their viewpoints)</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Character acknowledging another character without speaking (tip of the hat, nod, etc.)</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Character voicing salutation to another character or other extremely brief interchange</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Character entering into conversation with another character</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Character having intimate contact with another character</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you want to take a closer look at the datasets for the Bloomsday visualizations, I did <a href="http://goo.gl/DW4lxd" >open viewing of our data recording spreadsheet to the public</a> (and am happy to give anyone who wishes to augment the dataset editing capability). You can also check out the CSVs I imported to Gephi (<a href="/assets/WanderingRocks1.csv" >Wandering Rocks spreadsheet</a>, <a href="/assets/StartOfBook1.csv" >Start of Book spreadsheet</a>), which have removed everything but the source, target, and weight columns; cleaned up a few errors; and been saved as CSV files.</p>
<h3>How Do I Get My Data into Gephi?</h3>
<p>Save your spreadsheet as a CSV (in Google Spreadsheet, File > Download As > CSV). Open up Gephi. (If you're on a Mac, you'll probably need to download the 0.8.1beta version of Gephi as of Septmeber 2013, since it doesn't seem to work on OSX--freezes on the data laboratory screen.)</p>
<p>Click on the "start a new project" option in the pop-up screen. Look at the top to see three tabs, with "Data Laboratory" being the middle tab; click on it!</p>
<p>A bit lower and to the left under the tab you just clicked will be an "import spreadsheet" button. Click it and navigate to your CSV file. Under "as table", choose "edges table". Click next.</p>
<p>Make sure weight, label, and create missing nodes are checked, and click finish.</p>
<p>One more step! At the bottom of the page, click on the "copy data to other column" button and choose "ID". In the box that pops up, make sure "label" is chosen and click okay. This will place a label on each node (dot) with the name of the person represented by that dot.</p>
<p>Now, go back to those three tabs at the top of the screen and click on "overview" to play around with the layout of your data, and later on click on the "preview" tab to see how your final visualization will look and download an image file of the visualization.</p>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p><a title="View DHQ: Getting Started with Gephi for DH Vis (Part II of II)" href="/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt2">This post</a> has more on what to do once you've got your dataset imported into Gephi, as well as links to other people's less basic Gpehi tutorials. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>For this year's Bloomsday, <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/Rajarmstrong" >Rhonda Armstrong</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/reginahiggins" >Regina Higgins</a>, Steven Hoelscher, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Plandrews14" >Pamela Andrews</a></strong> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek" >I</a> collaborated digitally to extend the <em>Ulysses</em> dataset and visualization work begun at THATCamp Prime 2012 (aka Bloomsday 2012). Rhonda, Regina, Steven, and Pamela each thoroughly scoured ten pages of the book to add to our knowledge about the network of character relationships in the novel, and I extended last year's "Wandering Rocks" visualization (off of the data created by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ChadRut" ><strong>Chad Rutkowski</strong></a> and me in 2012), adding in weights showing the "depth" of each character interaction. A huge thank-you to Rhonda, Regina, Steven, and Pamela for their time and effort expanding the public dataset of <em>Ulysses</em> character interactions!</p>
<p><em><strong>So!</strong></em> You can start immediately below with reading my meta-analysis of the project (basically, how a non-weekend viz project might attack the same problem), <a href="#viz">jump down to inspect the visualizations</a>, or jump even farther to <a href="#instructions">read the instructions and suggestions</a> I shared with this year's scholars (including an explanation of the "weight" system we used to record a subjective depth to each character interaction).</p>
<p><em><strong> Related: </strong></em>You can <a title="O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)" href="/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis">check out last year's Bloomsday visualization work</a>, or read the tutorials (<a title="View DHQ: Visualizing Data from Digital Humanities Quarterly (Part I of II)" href="/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt1">1</a>, <a title="View DHQ: Getting Started with Gephi for DH Vis (Part II of II)" href="/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt2">2</a>) for making basic Gephi (infoviz software) visualizations that I created as part of <a title="Mapping the Flow of Knowledge with “View DHQ”: ACH Microgrant Award" href="/2012/04/19/ach-microgrant-award">my ACH Microgrant work</a>.</p>
<h3>Lessons from the Mini-Project</h3>
<p><strong>1. The big caveats with the dataset</strong> were caused by my decision to assign volunteers ten-page sections before the actual event: people needed to use the edition of <em>Ulysses</em> they had on hand (which meant assigning increments of ten pages to different people meant different, possibly overlapping, sections of the book were covered), and because some people needed to drop out of participating before Bloomsday, there are gaps in coverage (e.g. pages 1-10 aren't covered). The current dataset covers the following pieces of the book: pages 11-40 and 101-110 (1990 Vintage edition), pages 71-80 (the Project Gutenberg e-text), and pages 81-90 (1961 Modern Library edition)...plus all of "Wandering Rocks".</p>
<p>In retrospect, I probably should have handled dividing pages differently—a better way to handle page numbering: wait until the day of the event to assign pages to those who are still participating, and either require use of the same edition (maybe by scanning and sending out the needed pages to volunteers, so no has the barrier to participation of needing to buy a different edition of <em>Ulysses</em>) or falling back to the non-authoritative Project Gutenberg e-text (easy to copy and paste different sections of the text into emails to the different participants; flaws of this version of the text don't majorly impact our character relationship recording activities). On the other hand, much of the interest in helping out with this project is tied to a desire to (re)read <em>Ulysses</em>, and letting scholars use their preferred edition is important to that reading experience.</p>
<p>Would I do this project again? Absolutely! The participants were amazing collaborators, volunteering their time and effort to expand a public dataset, and having a chance to learn just a bit more about information visualization is always a treat. Next time, though, I'll need to take more time planning out more thorough coverage of a single edition of the work. I'd also spend more time packaging our finished data for use by others (e.g. those with more Gephi chops than me). I did <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pndZ58IrPtxJi7MsF4fzSQ4TKroCQPrONYo2H989Gk/edit#gid=2" >open viewing of our data recording spreadsheet to the public</a> (and am happy to give anyone who wishes to augment the dataset editing capability). You can also check out the CSVs I imported to Gephi (<a href="/assets/WanderingRocks.csv" >Wandering Rocks spreadsheet</a>, <a href="/assets/StartOfBook.csv" >Start of Book spreadsheet</a>), which put the data we gathered in the Google Spreadsheet into Gephi-ingestable form (and fix a few redundant variant-spellings and the like). Given its issues (gaps in page coverage, data from different editions), I didn't actively court anyone to use our data. Next time, with better coverage of the book, I'd reach out to DH tweeps who work more regularly in infoviz to help augment and use the data. <strong>But!</strong> If you want to work with any of the data or visualizations images, please go ahead! This post, the dataset on GoogleDocs, the two CSVs linked above, and the three visualization images in this post are all CC BY.</p>
<p><strong>2. Visualizations without explanation? (Sacrilege!) </strong>Given the holiday and learning nature of this project, we didn't approach it with quite the same end goal as most "proper" visualization projects (by which I mean, scholarship with project-length time and effort, producing an end result of narrated new knowledge). The data creation by the team's scholars was rigorous under the given parameters of a defined but sometimes ambiguous weight spectrum and non-continuous selections from the novel, but it was also a weekend project: looking at the visualizations below, I can confirm some expectations and enjoy getting an unusually broad view of the network of the novel's socializing, but there is much more someone with the time and interest can do!</p>
<p>A full visualization project would benefit from continuous data, or at least data with interesting ways of separating non-continuous sets of pages (e.g. all sections when Stephen is physically present as a way of looking on his effect on social interaction). Some things we'd do with more time to devote to this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'd <strong>analyze the different interaction-type encodings</strong> and their placement along a spectrum of relationship intimacy, probably coming up with a better set of weights and a more convincing and clear narrative for each of the interaction types on that scale.</li>
<li>We'd <strong>predict the visualizations' appearances, and analyze how the actual visualization differed and why</strong>, as well as discuss other types of new knowledge gained or gainable from the visualization—or <strong>what data was missing</strong> that could make new knowledge possible.</li>
<li>We'd also <strong>discuss the algorithms</strong> used to produce the visualizations, something I'm not (yet!) able to do that is of <em>tantamount importance</em> to scholarly visualization (as with any work that sues a tool, you need to understand how the tool functions to understand its results, its possible biases and blindspots, etc.).</li>
<li>We could <strong>compare the visualization results of multiple layout algorithms</strong>, and analyze their different visual arguments or different aspects of character relationships they variously highlight.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's by no means an exhaustive list, and again, I feel that this kind of dipping ones toes into the waters of a new technique is important—as long as you are aware of what, if any, arguments you're trying to make with your scholarly (or weekend scholar) production.</p>
<p><strong>3. Gephi problems!</strong> The current version of Gephi (0.8.2beta) wasn't working on OSX 10.8.4; it loads fine but freezes on the data laboratory screen. I reverted to an older version (0.8.1beta) that works fine, after losing some time trying to get things working.</p>
<p><strong>4. The subjectivity of placing types of relationship interactions along a spectrum</strong> (or even just of placing character interactions into "types") could definitely benefit from more debate and detail (see below for a table of the interaction coding we used—I think we came up with it during THATCamp Prime 2012?). The spectrum as it stands has several issues. The sometimes-directionality of the weights made it difficult to know when to record more than one interaction; the codes have both one-way interactions types (X thinks about Y) and two-way interactions (X and Y have a conversation). The interaction code <em>3</em>, "Omniscient third person narrator (for when two people interact, but it isn't from just one of their viewpoints)", was meant to control for directionality and make "source" and "target" designations meaningful, but didn't end up being useful because interaction codes 4-7 were ambiguous as to direction.</p>
<p>A relatedly subjective issue arose from the choice of node names; for example, the woman's arm that flings a coin to the one-legged sailor clearly belongs to Molly (though maybe not clearly at that point in one's reading)—should that interaction accrue to the "Molly" node, or should a second "her" node be created? Other portions of the book would provide similar problems (e.g. Martha Clifford/Nurse Callan).</p>

<h3>The Visualizations</h3>
<p><strong>Visualization A, Wandering Rocks Redux. </strong><em>(Click image to view larger.)</em> A visualization of characters interacting with other characters in the "Wandering Rocks" chapter (all pages of chapter covered), with lines weighted by "depth" of the interaction: more intimate encounters have a heavier weight, while "lighter" encounters (e.g. character thinks of another characters or salutes them but does not converse) have lighter connecting lines. See the "Instructions" section below for more on this weighting process. (<em>This visualization augments <a title="O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)" href="/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis">last year's infoviz</a> by adding weights for each encounter.)</em><br>

<p><strong>Visualization B, All Characters in Selections from the Beginning of <em>Ulysses</em>.</strong> <em>(Click image to view larger.)</em> Below, character interactions drawn from selections near the beginning of the novel: pages 11-40 and 101-110 (1990 Vintage edition), pages 71-80 (the Project Gutenberg e-text), and pages 81-90 (1961 Modern Library edition). Again, lines are weighted by "depth" of the interaction: more intimate encounters have a heavier weight.<br>

<p><strong>Visualization C, the major socializers in the beginning selections from <em>Ulysses. </em></strong><em></em><em>(Click image to view larger.)</em><em> </em>Below, a different look at the same dataset (selections from the beginning of the novel). The visualization above shows a node for each character recorded, which makes it less readable. Below, I filtered the dataset to only show those characters who interacted with more than one other person (in Gephi, go to filters > topology > degree range and set how many edges a node must have to appear), giving an easier view of the major socializers in this part of the book (again, lines are weighted with thicker lines showing more intimate interaction).</p>

<h3>Instructions for Gathering Data on Character Interactions</h3>
<p>The instructions I sent to the other members of the team:</p>
<p>1.<b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each of you should have access to the Bloomsday InfoViz spreadsheet</span>,</b> where you can see who's been assigned which pages/sections of the book and record your data (check your inbox for a link sent by Google). Please feel very free to take a different or additional set of pages, or do a smaller or larger number of pages than you volunteered for—just make a note on the spreadsheet so we don't do redundant work. Note that the spreadsheet has three different sheets (tabs at the bottom of the page): one for claiming pages, one for recording your data, and one with info on how to code the type of character interaction.</p>
<p>2. There's a bit of difficulty in working together with potentially different editions/page numbers of the book. If you could each<b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">let me know the publisher/year of the copy of Ulysses you're using</span></b> (on the spreadsheet's first sheet), I'll make sure we're not accidentally overlapping [well, that turned out to be too difficult...]. Alternatively or in addition to reading from a print book, you might copy and paste the chunk you want to work on from the Project Gutenberg e-text into a word document; I find this makes skimming for character interactions easier, since you can go through and highlight things. The e-text doesn't have page numbers as far as a I recall, so if you work this way please just let me know the sentence you start and end on.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Read or skim for character interactions!</b></span> (See below for details*.)</p>
<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Record the interactions you read on the spreadsheet</b>. </span>The columns are used as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>This Person [Source]<br>
</b></li>
<li><b>Interacts with This Person [Target]</b>: for people speaking to each other, no need to write things twice—that is, when Stephen and Mulligan talk on top of the tower at the start of the book, just record one row with Stephen in either column 1 or 2 and Mulligan the same (the "type of interaction" code will let us know whether it's a directional interaction—that is, person in column 1 is thinking of person in column 2—or a mutual interaction such as a dialogue)</li>
<li><b>Type of Interaction</b>: See the third sheet (tab at the bottom of the spreadsheet that says "Codes for Character Interactions" for info on how to code types of interaction here</li>
<li><b>Episode or Page Numbers:</b> Note which episode or range of page numbers in which this interaction occurs (no need to mark specific page number; you can just record e.g. that something occurred in your range of pages 80-99)</li>
<li><b>Edition (Publisher, Date) of Book Used</b></li>
<li><b>Who Did This Work?: </b>Your name (so we can credit you for your contribution!)</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>* So what's an interaction?</b></span></h3>
<ol>
<li>We're treating an "interaction" as some type of interchange between two characters; if more than two characters are interacting, please break these into pairs of two characters that represent all interactions going on and record the two names with one name in column 1 and the other name in column 2 (this will let our software draw lines between each pairing of characters). For example, when Haines, Mulligan, and Stephen eat breakfast together in the first chapter of the book, you'd add three rows: Haines and Mulligan, Haines and Stephen, Mulligan and Stephen. Note that for people speaking to each other, no need to write things twice—that is, when Stephen and Mulligan talk on top of the tower at the start of the book, just record one row with Stephen in either column 1 or 2 and Mulligan in the other column; the "type of interaction" code will let us know whether it's a directional interaction—that is, person in column 1 is thinking of person in column 2—or a mutual interaction such as a dialogue.</li>
<li><b>Deciding when interactions between characters start and end will have to be a bit subjective—just use your best judgement.</b> An "interaction" is a chunk of communication such as a dialogue, a speech directed at one or more specific characters, or thinking about an absent character; "chunk" means that we'll think of an interaction as ending (allowing a new one that occurs later to be recorded as a separate interaction) when communication ends, other events intervene, or the thinker starts thinking about something or someone else. for example: Does Bloom think about Molly while walking along the street, and then think about other stuff, and then think about Molly again? I'd count that as two interactions. Among other interactions in the opening chapter ("Telemachus"), Stephen and Mulligan talk on the roof of the tower, then Stephen is left alone (and thinks about Mulligan), and then Stephen and Mulligan have a different interaction (breakfast with Haines) downstairs; I'd count those as three different interactions.</li>
<li><b>You don't need to spend time agonizing over where interactions end and what type of interaction took place—</b>just use your best judgement and have fun! If you're really unsure, leave a brief note in the "comments" column to the right of the row with the questionable interaction and I can check it out. The idea is to get as rich a recording of interactions as possible (e.g. to get a sense of how often thoughts of Molly invade Bloom's day) without, for example, recording every line of a dialogue as a separate interaction.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Codes for Character Interactions</h3>
<p>Coded interactions by number along a highly subjective spectrum of relationship depth (see "Lessons" section above for some of the issues that rose from this coding):</p>
