    <p><em>View the site related to this post: <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/">digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ</a></em>. <em>Huge thanks to the <a href="http://www.ach.org">ACH</a> for funding this work!</em></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt1/">the first part of this blog post</a>, I discussed the results of a small visualization project funded by a <a href="http://ach.org/2012/04/19/ach-announces-microgrants-winners/">2012 ACH Microgrant</a>: visualizing the flow of DH knowledge as captured by citation networks and other measures from <em><a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/">Digital Humanities Quarterly</a></em> (<em>DHQ</em>). You can view some of the products of the project <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/">here</a>, read more about <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/04/19/ach-microgrant-award/">the initial proposal</a> here, or jump back to <a title="View DHQ: Visualizing Data from Digital Humanities Quarterly (Part I of II)" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt1/" >Part One of this post</a> to read more about the project's outcome. Now, I'll discuss some of the technical details of creating DH visualizations...</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Gephi</h2>
<p><strong>Beta. </strong>Gephi is free, open-source visualization software for Mac, Windows, and Linux available from <a href="http://www.gephi.org">Gephi.org</a>. Its beta status (currently 0.8.1-beta) meant I periodically ran into some small bugs (usually fixed by deleting the user library and reinstalling); the largest beta-style issue was that visualization images weren't exporting as editable files (e.g. SVGs), meaning I couldn't put on any final touches to the images using design software like Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Terminology.</strong> Outside these minor issues, I found it quite easy to start making basic visualizations with Gephi. As I began working with various datasets, I found my workflow fell into two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking about what I'm trying to display--either specifics ("I want to show how many steps it takes to connect Jean Valjean to any other character in <em>Les Miserables"</em>), or a general sense of what kind of interesting things you're hoping to see pop out ("How is knowledge being cited and reused in <em>DHQ</em>? What are some of the most frequently cited writings in DH?")--and structuring my dataset appropriately. What do you want to show, and what data must you record to model that idea?<em></em>
<p><img title="DHQ Stack Issue" alt="DHQ Stack Issue" src="/assets/stack.jpg" width="500" height="323">We worried that DHQ's 110 articles would show little interconnectedness, so we planned on adding additional measures to the visualizations.</li>
<li>Importing the dataset into Gephi and working with the data through the visual interface--either experimentally ("Let's try some different layouts and filters see if anything interesting pops up!") or with a predetermined purpose ("I want to determine the five most frequently cited works in <em>DHQ</em>'s citation set, then display how all the other articles and citations are webbed among these key five nodes").</li>
</ol>
<p>Gephi can handle complex data--e.g. a dynamic stream of Twitter hashtag results--but a dataset can also be a ridiculously simple thing, so this article will assume we're all working with some pretty basic sets of data. Some quick terminology might help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of a visualization as a bunch of objects connected by links--circles and lines, at the most simple level. The objects are <strong></strong>called<strong> nodes</strong> and the links are called <strong>edges</strong>. Each visualization dataset will model various nodes and the way they are connected via edges.</li>
<li><strong>Edges</strong> can be given <strong>weights</strong>, which are just some kind of quantitative measure that tells you something about each given edge between two nodes. One possible measure you could use to weight your edges is <strong>degree</strong>, which is the number of edges connecting to a node, representing how interconnected that node is.</li>
<li>Visualizations can be directed or undirected; <strong>directed</strong> edges only point one way (from node A -> node B but not also B -> A), while <strong>undirected</strong> edges point both ways. A dataset that records each and every character interaction in a book might choose to use <strong>directed</strong> edges to connect character nodes if it were recording interactions such as thinking about or overhearing someone, while a similar dataset that only recorded interactions that are dialogues could be undirected, since the interaction modeled by the edge goes both ways.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My First <del datetime="2012-07-11T08:56:58+00:00">Sony</del> Dataset</h2>
<p>For the visualizations with <em>DHQ</em> and with <a title="O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis/" ><em>Ulysses</em></a> I've worked on recently, my datasets have largely been two- or three-column spreadsheets showing the relationship between a pair of items, plus sometimes a weight (i.e. some quantified measure of that relationship such as number of times a pair of characters meet). For the <a title="O rocks! Tell it to us in plain images (A THATCamp/Bloomsday Visualization)" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/06/26/bloomsdayvis/" ><em>Ulysses</em> "Wandering Rocks" visualization</a>, we simply had one column for the "source" (the node for a person leading the interaction) and one column for the "target" (the focus of that interaction). Thus, one row in a general <em>Ulysses</em> interaction dataset might have a source cell saying "Bloom" and a target cell saying "Molly", to record a social interaction where the character Bloom spoke to Molly. Make sure that any nodes (your characters, articles, objects, etc.) that are mentioned multiple times within a dataset are always identified in the same way with the exact same spelling so that Gephi can identify each mention as referring to the same thing (e.g. we always referred to one character as Fr. Conmee, never sometimes as Father Conmee).</p>
<p><img title="Ulysses Wandering Rocks Dataset Snapshot" alt="Ulysses Wandering Rocks Dataset Snapshot" src="/assets/ulsvis.jpg" width="586" height="265">A snapshot of part of the super-basic dataset spreadsheet for the "Wandering Rocks" visualization.</p>
<p>For the first three <em>DHQ</em> visualizations, I had "source", "target", and "weight" columns, where each row recorded data about one <em>DHQ</em> article (the source), one of the articles in its bibliography (the target), and a weight for that edge (we decided to weigh edges by the number of times an item in an article's bibliography was explicitly cited in the main text of that article).</p>
<p>Once you've set up a dataset (and there are other ways to do this, but for a simple dataset, importing a spreadsheet as a CSV is probably the easiest)--you're ready to check out your data in Gephi. Fire up the program and note the three main area tabs at the top of the interface:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong> is where you'll work with your dataset in visual form, trying out different layouts, filtering for specific data, customizing colors and labels, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Laboratory </strong>is where you can view a spreadsheet version of your dataset; when viewing a visualization image in the Overview, for example, you might want to right-click and select "View in Data Laboratory" to see the specifics of a given node. <strong>Laboratory</strong> is also where you'll want to head to import your dataset ("Import Spreadsheet"), following <a href="https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Import-CSV-Data" >these instructions</a> if you need a little extra help. Once you've imported your dataset successfully, you can jump back to the <strong>Overview</strong> view to start playing with your data.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong> is the pane for seeing how your final visualization looks to the world, allowing you to make final customizations (e.g. background and label coloring) and choose how to export your visualization (as noted above, .PNG seems to be the current best option for Mac users).</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p><img alt="Circular visualization of Les Miserables character interconnections" src="/assets/Untitled1.png" width="456" height="456">A quick visualization of character relations in the Gephi Les Miserables dataset.</p>
<p>The best way to learn Gephi is to import a dataset with which you're familiar; if you don't currently have one of your own, try opening the one of Gephi's <a href="https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Datasets">example datasets</a> that is most familiar to you (perhaps it's the connections between characters in Victor Hugo's novel <em>Les Miserables</em>, or a network of nearly all (?) the Marvel superheroes). I'll cover a few of the many buttons and widgets below, but the best way to learn is probably to</p>
<ul>
<li>begin with Gephi's <a href="https://gephi.github.io/users/">three basic tutorials,</a></li>
<li>check out Elijah Meeks and Molly Wilson’s beautiful work with <a href="http://dhs.stanford.edu/dh/gephi/dhstanford2.html">visualizing DH work at Stanford</a> for an aspirational example,</li>
<li>and start trying out buttons in the Overview pane to see what they do (hover your cursor over most buttons for a helpful explanation of what each thing does)</li>
</ul>
<p>Gephi maintains a <a href="http://forum.gephi.org">forum</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki" >wiki</a> that probably hold answers to most of your basic questions; also check out the list of Gephi <a href="https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugins/" >plugins</a>, which add functionalities such as embedding zoomable visualizations in your web page and pulling data from Twitter.</p>
<h2>Three Features to Explore</h2>
<p>Once you've got your dataset imported and you're on the Overview pane:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play around with <strong>layouts</strong> (bottom-left of page; select a layout form the drop-down menu, then hit "run" to begin the layout algorithm and "stop" when desired). Options include a <strong>circular</strong> layout (arranges nodes alphabetically around the circle's edges, as with the <em>Les Miserables</em> visualization above), the <strong>force-directed</strong> layout (which takes into account the tightness of interlinkages among nodes), <strong>expansion</strong> (increases space among nodes for better readability), and the <strong>node adjust</strong> and <strong>noverlap</strong> layouts (which also help your labels be readable).</li>
<li>Use <strong>filters</strong> to highlight specific parts of your dataset (upper-right corner). For example, you can <em>filter out all but the most interconnected nodes</em> by double-clicking Filters > Topology > Degree Range, then using the slider that appear at the bottom-right to choose for what range of degrees nodes should be displayed (you can also click the number at either end of the range and type in a number, if the slider isn't fine enough for your needs), then click "filter" to see the results. For example, we could use this filter on the <em>Les Mis</em> dataset to only show characters who interact with at least three other characters by setting the minimum degree to 3.</li>
<li>Adjust <em>edge, node, and label size and coloring</em> using the <strong>ranking</strong> options in the upper-left. For example, for the DHQ dataset (which weights edges by how many times a target citation is mentioned in the source node article) choose the edges tab underneath "ranking", then choose the parameter "weight". Use the tiny palette icon (upper-right of the pane, but below the drop-down menu) to choose a color scheme, the min/max fields to limit the sizes possible, and use the other small icons (upper-right of the pane, above the drop-down menu) to choose whether to effect edge color, label color, or node size. Click apply to see your changes.</li>
</ul>

    <p><em>View the site related to this post: <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/" >digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ</a></em>. <em>Huge thanks to the <a href="http://www.ach.org">ACH</a> and their Microgrant project for funding this work!</em></p>
<p>Last week, I finished up a small project funded by a <a href="http://ach.org/2012/04/19/ach-announces-microgrants-winners/">2012 ACH Microgrant</a>: visualizing the flow of DH knowledge as captured by citation networks and other measures from <em><a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/">Digital Humanities Quarterly</a></em> (<em>DHQ</em>). You can view some of the products of the project <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/">here</a>, read more about <a href="/2012/07/ach-microgrant-award">the initial proposal</a> here, or read about how to make DH visualizations in <a title="View DHQ: Getting Started with Gephi for DH Vis (Part II of II)" href="/2012/07/viewdhqpt2">Part Two of this post</a>.</p>
<p  id="internal-source-marker_0.10593006076464029">This project proposed a visualization of <em></em>DHQ's citation network with an eye toward identifying the flow and reuse of key texts in the DH community. Previous DH citation network research focused on exploring which journals include DH work, not on which individual DH works are cited within journals; this microgrant allowed me to conduct preliminary explorations with rendering the existing DHQ citation content more easily analyzed through visualizations, as well as make some recommendations for future DHQ visualization work in terms of improving metadata (an area that's also being more thoroughly tackled by <a href="https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HD-51084-10">this NEH-funded project</a> on improving DH bibliographic data), creating a streamlined workflow for dynamically updating visualizations of DHQ content, and embedding visualizations on the DHQ site.</p>
<p>The work supported by this grant is mostly visible on the webpages at <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ">digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ</a>, which traces my project of visualizing DHQ through five visualizations. These visualizations outline several ways of seeing an interesting dataset: one with much potential to reflect meaningful issues of knowledge reuse and representation within the DH community, but also presenting some issues in terms of relatively small size (110 articles), limited interconnectedness of citations, and metadata markup.</p>
<p><img title="2nd DHQ Visualization" alt="2nd DHQ Visualization" src="/assets/2small.png" width="1000" height="600">One of the visualizations produced during the project: <strong>who, when included in a work's bibliography, gets cited specifically a lot in the text of that article?</strong>.</p>
<p>All five visualizations relied on the full (as of April 2012) set of 110 DHQ articles, identified throughout by their XML IDs (e.g. dhq-000009) and scraped from the DHQ website by the code magic of MITH Assistant Director Travis Brown. The first three visualizations explore DHQ’s citation network through</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis1.html">providing an overview</a> of the dataset</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis2.html">exploring the frequency of “namechecking”</a> in DHQ (if a work is cited by a DHQ article, how many times is that work cited by name in the main text of the article?)</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis3.html">identifying the DHQ articles with the most interlinkages</a> (how many other works cite it or are cited by it?)</p>
<p>The dataset for these first three visualizations identifies 2,473 linked pairings between the 110 DHQ articles and each of the works cited within them. Recording how many times a cited work was mentioned within the article citing it as a "weight" to these links (e.g. the dhq-000105 article mentions a 2010 article by Cohen twice--once in the bibliography and once in the main article text--thus receiving a weight of 2) adds richness to this data.</p>
<p>369 of these unique citations each only appear once in their DHQ article’s XML file (i.e. the work was mentioned in the bibliography but not in the main text, at least not with the correct XML ID tag). Most of the citations (2,458 of them) were mentioned in the main text and bibliography between 1-9 times, with only 15 articles with ten or more mentions in an article citing them; dhq-000093 (Molly Gage’s “Winesburg, Ohio: A Modernist Kluge”) was the extreme case, citing Sherwood Anderson’s <em>Winesburg, Ohio</em> 44 times (suggesting it might be interesting to compare citation "namechecking" between more traditional literary articles and newer DH work...).</p>
<p>The last two visualizations focus on the similarity among DHQ articles by</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis4.html">running a topic modeling process on the DHQ articles</a></p>
<p>5. <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis5.html">identifying</a> those DHQ articles identified by the topic modeling process as having the highest degree of document similarity</p>
<p>These two visualizations used the 110 DHQ articles only (i.e. not the cited works as well, as in the first three images); the dataset used for these visualizations was produced by Travis Brown using the MALLET topic modeling package. This dataset identifies 5,996 linkages among DHQ articles (representing the linkages between each possible DHQ article pairing of two articles). Edge weights here represent degrees of document similarity among the DHQ articles; these weights record symmetrized KL-divergence, measuring the distance between probability distributions for each article such that the smallest divergence signifies articles with the closest topics. Check out Visualizations <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis4.html">4</a> and <a href="http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/vis5.html">5</a> for some thoughts on these images.</p>

<a href="/tag/james-joyce-and-ulysses">James Joyce & Ulysses</a>
      </span>

    <p>At <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org">THATCamp Prime</a> this year, I led <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/14/o-rocks-celebrating-bloomsday-dh-style/">a hack session</a> where we discussed small digital Joycean projects we might take on that day and continue hacking at over the following weeks. Session participants were Anastasia Salter, Ben Schmidt, Chad Rutkowski (part of the <em><a href="http://www.ulyssesseen.com">Ulysses Seen</a></em> team!), and Heather Prescott. I've been working a lot with the great open-source visualization software <a href="http://www.gephi.org">Gephi</a> recently (I'll be posting about the visualizations of <em><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/">Digital Humanities Quarterly</a></em> citations and articles I've just finished up fr an ACH Microgrant later this week!), so we decided to create a dataset that could be used in Gephi to make something both informative and pretty: a log of the social interactions among characters that could be turned into a social network visualization.</p>
<p>Chad read through the Wandering Rocks episode and logged a list of character interactions, which I then turned into a dataset and manipulated in Gephi to produce (click image for larger version):</p>
<p><img title="Wandering Rocks visualization" alt="Wandering Rocks visualization" src="/assets/wanderingrocks1.png" width="561" height="382"></p>
<p>Character nodes are weighted by the number of edges touching them (i.e. by how many interactions with other people a given character has), so unsurprisingly for anyone who's read <em>Ulysses</em>, Father Conmee appears as one of the most connected characters in the episode.</p>
<p>Our next step will be to answer some questions about types of character interactions and include these answers in our dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we want to log the direction of an interaction to cover cases where, for example, and conversation is one-sided? (Yes, but this means creating two edges for every dialogue: Bloom > Molly as well as Molly > Bloom).</li>
<li>What counts as an interaction? (Telegrams, letters, overheard shouts in the street?)</li>
<li>How do we handle time? (Is Bloom > Molly recorded only one time in our <em>Ulysses</em> datatset, or every time they interact? If the latter, how do we decide when an interaction counts as ended?) If we can find a satisfactory and non-insanity causing way of coding this, we could create a time-lapse visualization of interactions in the novel, perhaps with some sort of cumulative or heatmapping feature.</li>
<li>How to handle different types of interactions? We discussed assigning different numbered weights to interaction edges so that its easy to see the degree of interaction taking place (was a character imagining a conversation with Bloom, or actually talking to him?), but there's some difficulty in deciding what types of interaction are deeper than others in order to place these on a spectrum and make visual apprehension easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ben Schmidt also did some neat and quick work with the Circe episode, running a script to gather character names by grabbing the all-caps words in that section and mapping interactions stepwise by linking the names that appears next after a given character in the text.</p>
<p>We'll continue working on this project as we have time, so if you're interested in helping out, send us a tweet! The work involved is pretty easy: identifying a section of the novel you wish to attack, then making a list of the characters who interact and ID'ing the type of interaction according to a scheme we're using.</p>
