        Designing a digital scholarly article

    <p><em>I successfully defended my <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities doctoral dissertation</a> in Spring 2015. The now-available <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">Infinite Ulysses</a> social+digital reading platform is part of that project; <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">come read with us</a>!</em></p>

<p>I'll be speaking on a panel on "21st-Century Forms for the Dissertation" on Wednesday, and will have more general thoughts to share on using forms other than the monograph to convey your scholarly argument then. Today, though, I'll describe my plans for one of the pieces of my unusually formatted dissertation: <strong>an "interactive" scholarly article</strong> that will serve as public entrance into my dissertational research (I'll get to what the heck the much-abused word "interactive" means here in a minute!).</p>
<p>This dissertation's focus is a website—the <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro">Infinite Ulysses</a> participatory digital edition of James Joyce's novel <em>Ulysses</em>—and the critical design, coding, contextual annotation, and user-testing work that will make up that piece of scholarly digital editing (Note that I've downsized the project from the previous three different coding projects</a> to focus on just this Ulysses piece. The dissertation actually had five different coding projects when I was writing my prospectus for it originally... but then I decided I wanted to graduate! I may still pursue the Rochfort-Smith critical visual design project, but that'll depend on the kind of usability work I need to do on the Ulysses site after initial testing.). This "interactive" article is already building itself through my regular blogging on this site, but it will be more polished than some of this blogging, and also offer some writing that doesn't make it onto the blog for one reason or other, like a research bibliography and full analysis of my user-testing results. The article will also link out to the other pieces of my dissertational work: the <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro">Infinite Ulysses</a> participatory digital edition, code repositories, this blog, etc.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the dissertation, the idea was to work with a publishing platform that welcomes new media submissions so that I could publish my code/design work as well as my writing—but I've since decided that a developing form of web design that interests me would also be the perfect format for this article. I've called it "an interactive scholarly article" above, I call it an "HTML5 manifesto" in my head, and the <em>New York Times</em> calls their version of it "interactive storytelling", and I'm sure there's some specific phrase that would better capture the picture that's been developing in my head. What I'm hoping to produce is a HTML5 site that uses the fact that it isn't a printed page of paper to convey my argument.</p>
<h2>What does that look like?</h2>
<p>Let's look at some examples of this admittedly broad form to quickly give you the best sense of what I'm thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>The New York Time's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/12/30/year-in-interactive-storytelling/" >gallery of "interactive storytelling" pieces</a> from last year</li>
<li>Two random articles from elsewhere on the web I've had bookmarked as examples: an <a href="http://eephusleague.com/magazine/" >article on baseball history</a> and one on <a href="http://editsquarterly.com/" >photography/film</a></li>
<li><a href="http://octoverse.github.com/" >GitHub's example</a> is more like a scrolling slideshow, but I like the emphasis on graphics and charts</li>
<li>Pretty sure I've read some e-lit that functions very similarly, too...</li>
</ul>
<p>These all function by scrolling down to reveal more content (rather than using the codex-holdover of multiple pages), and employ features such as typography, layout, and embedded video to unfold their narrative—an approach I've personally enjoyed reading, and that gives me a better mental map of the argument I'm following than a traditional paper does.</p>
<p>Text is chunked into sections that may be related in more than the normal linear fashion, in order to cover the multiple but related preoccupations of my work. A virtue of this approach is that I can use space to make an argument more easily than in the confines of an ordinary print page. For example, to discuss the speculative experiment part of my work as it impacts different mechanical pieces of my site such as tagging and voting, I can branch the page into three areas representing different aspects of the approach in respect to each feature, with and links arrows connecting among these three strains of thought—or maybe a chart listing "features" down one side (tagging, voting, etc.) and how past scholarly attempts (e.g. how other DH projects have experienced crowd-tagging), my usability study (e.g. the reality of crowd-tagging I observe via my user study), and my thought experiment (what I think I might observe if the site actually encountered the speculative state of being annotated and tagged by "everyone") each reflect on that feature.</p>
<p>If this is a bit hard to picture... it's because this is an approach for those times when you really need to be drawing on a whiteboard at the same time as talking, or showing a slide, or otherwise supporting verbal argument with visuals.</p>
<h2>Possible Issues: Accessibility, Effort</h2>
<p>I'll need to do some research into the accessibility of this design approach, but I think that unlike similar-looking sites from years ago (e.g. sites using image slices, Flash, and other early-e-lit-like approaches), the use of clean HTML5 here actually lets the content be extremely screenreader-friendly (well structured, free from cruft). That also means that the core textual content should be easy to print off for purposes of pre-defense comments.</p>
<p>I'll also need to be certain I don't get distracted by the fun of designing/coding this article at the expense of time that could be better spent on other aspects of the dissertation. I think this approach is definitely worth the effort: it's likely to welcome more people to reading my dissertation, and make the dissertation more accessible in multiple senses of the word (available on the web, form/layout supports understanding of arguments, link to further reading on non-literary terms of art such as the HCI terminology I'll be using). Being a really fun thing to do as a web designer is just a happy bonus of the form!</p>

        Tutorial: Omeka+Imagemagick Happiness with MAMP Pro 3

<p>If you make websites, you've probably worked with <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" >Imagemagick</a> and know it's a <a href="http://omeka.org/forums/search.php?q=imagemagick" >pain in</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topicsearchin/omeka-dev/imagemagick|sort:date|spell:true" >the butt</a> to get working (especially for Mac local development)—and if you want to use an awesome CMS like <a href="http://www.omeka.org" >Omeka</a> (super for digital archives, collections, museums) to display still images, you'll need Imagemagick. Used to be you'd need to lose some time finagling (possibly setting up Homebrew) to get ImageMagick to work, but if you're already using MAMP, it might be worth your while to <a href="http://blog-en.mamp.info/" >upgrade to MAMP Pro 3</a> and make things easier on yourself.</p>
<h2>Instructions (once you've <a href="http://blog-en.mamp.info/" >installed MAMP Pro 3</a>)</h2>
<p><em>These instructions assume knowledge of installing an Omeka site locally using MAMP.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>In the MAMP config window, go to the "PHP" tab and note which version of PHP you're using.
<p><img alt="Where to locate the version of PHP MAMP is using" src="/assets/whichphp.png" width="748" height="172"></p><p>Look under the PHP tab in the MAMP Pro 3 settings window to locate the version of PHP MAMP is using.</li>
<li>In Finder, go to and open in a text editor this file: <strong><em>/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.10/conf/php.ini</em> </strong>Note that you're looking in the MAMP (not MAMP Pro) folder, and that you should replace "<em>php5.5.10</em>" in the file path above with the folder that matches whatever version of PHP you identified you're using in Step #1 (i.e. go into whatever folder has the same PHP version you're using—I'm just using PHP 5.5.10 in this example).</li>
<li>Find the line that says <strong>;extension=imagick.so</strong> (line 542 in my MAMP Pro 3.0.2) and remove the semi-colon from the front of the line (so the line now just says <strong>extension=imagick.so</strong>). This uncomments the imagemagick module so that MAMP makes it available.</li>
<li>Save the file and close it. You may need to restart your MAMP servers or just restart MAMP for this change to take effect.</li>
<li>Go to the "settings" tab on the admin dashboard for your local Omeka site (yoursitename/admin/settings/edit-settings), scroll to the bottom, and enter <strong>/usr/local/bin</strong> in the "ImageMagick Directory Path" field. Click the "Save Changes" button on the upper-right.
<p><img alt="Where to type the ImageMagick path in the Omeka dashboard settings" src="/assets/imagemagickpath.png" width="546" height="90"> Type the ImageMagick path at the bottom of the page in the Omeka dashboard settings.</li>
<li>Imagemagick should now work—you should be able to add "still image" types of files to your local Omeka site, and Omeka will create thumbnails of the images and display the thumbnails and original size images correctly. If you've got a bunch of images you want to add as separate items, I recommend using the <a href="http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/dropbox/" >Dropbox plugin</a> (doesn't have anything to do with the Dropbox backup site), which lets you batch upload a folder full of images.</li>
</ol>
<h2>An Alternative: Vagrant</h2>
<p>Note that another way to make Imagemagick finagling simpler is to use <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" >Vagrant</a> (if you've ever worked with a virtual machine, for example to run Windows on a Mac, it's like developing in a virtual machine and being able to easily boot up a machine with a new copy of the CMS of your choice configured how you want, easily move that dev site to a public site, and not have any of this mess with the settings on your host computer/laptop the way you might need to do when using MAMP).</p>
<p>In particular, the awesome digital humanities devs at <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/" >Scholars' Lab </a>share Vagrant+Chef code and documentation for <a href="http://www.omeka.org" >Omeka</a> sites <a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/cookbooks" >at this GitHub repo</a> (haven't actually used it myself yet, but planning to very soon). Working with Vagrant takes some learning, though, so if you don't have the time/desire to add a useful webdev skill to your toolkit just now, the MAMP Pro 3 route might be better for you.</p>
<p>Another option is <a href="https://github.com/michaelck/puppet-lamp-stack-for-omeka" >this Vagrant+Puppet LAMP/Omeka set-up</a> on GitHub by MichaelCK. (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/omeka-dev/0vkYN2pWWgM" >HT the Omeka Dev listserv!</a>)</p>
<p>I started using MAMP Pro 3 to make local Omeka dev easier after <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/omeka-dev/DVER4WHGUjc/UDAyWg4CcCwJ" >user niek noted its awesomeness</a> on the Omeka Dev listserv (hat tip!).</p>

        Digital Professionalism for Graduate Students: How to Use Twitter, Blogging, and the Rest of the Web as an Academic

    <p>Some reasons graduate students (and any scholars) should maintain an online presence, with an emphasis on using Twitter and blogging to develop intellectually and professionally:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blogging is magic</strong> (I'm blogging right now!). Blogging can help you develop content for your dissertation, article, or future conference paper, without the same constraints of sitting down to produce a formal essay. Blogging helps develop your unique voice and trains you to write for various audiences—not just the colleagues you're used to, but for those outside your field or outside academia as well (you should be able to explain your intellectual passions to a non-academic audience, anyway). Blogging publicly identifies you as actively engaged with the topics you research.</li>
<li>An online presence demonstrates <strong>competency at presenting yourself</strong>: professionalism in online interactions, and the social and intellectual acumen to develop a network of collaboration and discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Employers will look you up online</strong>. An online presence (CV site, LinkedIn account, Twitter) is your chance to shape what they see. What aspects of your work do you want to make certain prospective collaborators and colleagues see?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter lets you keep up on the latest</strong> academic arguments, productions, events, and opportunities. Besides helping you track a field's preoccupations on a schedule more frequent than your field's key periodicals, tweeting can also serve as note-taking during scholarly events.</li>
<li>Tweeting and blogging about your work <strong>can result in invitations</strong> to speak or serve on panels, take part in projects, and otherwise collaborate with like-minded thinkers.</li>
<li><strong>Most importantly</strong>: be part of the <em>digital</em> academic community, too:<br>

</ol>
<p>The following are notes from my part of <a href="http://www.english.umd.edu/events/5513" >a February 10, 2014 panel</a> in the University of Maryland English Department on using the digital as an academic professional. I presented with Professors <a href="http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/" >Matt Kirschenbaum</a>, <a href="http://madwomanwithalaptop.com/" >Marilee Lindemann</a>, and <a href="http://www.joshuaweiner.com/" >Joshua Weiner</a><em></em>.</p><p><em>Update: Marilee <a href="http://madwomanwithalaptop.com/2014/02/11/advice-for-virtual-and-actual-life-dont-be-a-butthead/" >posted her remarks from the panel</a> on her blog (<a href="http://madwomanwithalaptop.com/2014/02/11/advice-for-virtual-and-actual-life-dont-be-a-butthead/" >Madwoman with a Laptop</a>), and it's a great read: how university social media policies factor into your online presentation and future job search, balancing blogging (often a labor of love with less tangible benefits than traditional scholarly work) with efforts that are more commonly accepted toward tenure and promotion, and how to generally "not be a butthead" in your social media use.</em></p>

<h2><a id="cv"></a>Get Your CV/Portfolio Online</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandavisconti">LinkedIn</a> (connect with colleagues, join groups like the Versatile Ph.D. and the official groups for academic organizations where you're a member)</li>
<li><a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a> (for your academic blog, online portfolio, or class website; $12/first year, $20-30/year thereafter)</li>
<li>Free online website/portfolio services exist, but I don't know much about them. I'd caution against using them unless you can't find an alternative that works for you: you either get ads on your site (not super professional) or are stuck with a site that looks like a million others, as with Wordpress.com's free blog hosting. (On the other hand, non-web-devs probably don't notice or care that your Wordpress.com site looks like many others, and having a well-presented CV site is better than not having one.)</li>
<li>When structuring your CV/online portfolio, think about the areas of your professional life you want to emphasize; background that best supports your hiring in the type of job you desire or collaboration in activities of interest to you should be foremost. Create categories if they don't exist but would highlight your abilities. Don't let good skills/experiences get buried because they aren't highlighted by traditional CV categories (e.g. on my CV I have sections for professional grants I've applied for/the amounts I've been awarded for them, conferences and conference panels I've organized, and guest blog posts I've been asked to write).</li>
<li>CV or online portfolio? A digital CV is just like a print one, but it's readable online and/or downloadable as a PDF. An online portfolio is less of a list and more of a showcase of projects, papers, awards, and other achievements that define you as a scholar, allowing for fewer examples but more narrative.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="twitter"></a>How to Do Twitter as an Academic</h2>
<ul>
<li>Twitter basics: <strong>RT</strong> means "retweet" (share others' tweets with your followers while attributing the original tweeter); <strong>MT</strong> means "modified tweet" (use when RT'ing but shortening or otherwise altering the original tweet); <strong>ICYMI</strong> (in case you missed it).</li>
<li>RTs are easy to do (most apps have both an RT and a "quote"/MT button) and useful; <em>even better</em> is to read the link you're RT'ing, and prepend your RT with your thoughts (e.g. why you suggest reading it).</li>
<li>Starting a tweet <strong>@someone</strong> means that only that person and people who follow both you and that person will see the tweet in their timelines (although anyone can see the tweet by visiting either of your timelines). Put a period in front of the @username to let all your followers read it. When quoting someone, always attribute; the <strong>.@someone</strong> trick is the concise, accepted way of doing this if the person has a Twitter handle:<br>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/jeremydouglass">@jeremydouglass</a> Can&#39;t simply continue to read the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/elit?src=hash">#elit</a> works we care about now, need to also discover/recover the non-canon</p>&mdash; Amanda Visconti (@Literature_Geek) <a href="https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/428988369847066624">January 30, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

</li>
<li>Use hashtags if you want people who are searching for that hashtag to find your tweet. Hashtags for conferences, events, and courses are a great way to follow along. Most people use non-event hashtags sparingly #because #they're #not #fun #to #read.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://storify.com/">Storify</a> to curate tweets and other social media, as with show an online conversation that happened in response to an event (here's <a href="http://storify.com/literature_geek/any-examples-of-lit-dept-phd-dissertations-that-do">an example Storify</a> I made of a Twitter conversation about digital dissertations)</li>
<li>Various Twitter apps (e.g. Tweetdeck) let you schedule tweets ahead of time. This is great if you want to tweet links to your work while speaking on a panel, or to sync a tweet linking to a new blog post of yours with the publication of that post.</li>
<li>Keeping up with Twitter can take time; I've moved my Twitter usage off my computer (so I'm not distracted while working) and check it while commuting on the train.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="follow"></a>Who/What to Follow on Twitter</h2>
<p>Some following ideas for starting out on Twitter:</p>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/lists/umd-english-tweeps">UMD English Twitter List </a>(faculty, graduate students, alumni; tweet <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Literature_Geek" >@Literature_Geek</a> to be added)... or for non-UMD folks, check if anyone in your department has started a similar list (if not, starting it yourself is a good excuse to tweet with others on your campus)</li>
<li>Live-tweeted events (e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mla14&src=typd" >the MLA conference</a>; see <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23elit&src=typd" >the #elit hashtag</a> for an event on electronic literature we live-tweeted at MITH a week and a half ago). Search <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mla14&src=typd" >#ml14</a> and #s + the session number you're interested in (e.g. #mla14 #s421; see <a href="http://www.mla.org/pdf/2014conventionguide3web.pdf" >the online MLA program</a> for these).</li>
<li>W. W. Norton's (of giant Norton Anthology fame) <a href="https://twitter.com/wwnorton/thinkers/members">list of public intellectuals</a></li>
<li>Lists created by fellow graduate students, academics in your field, or of people attending a given academic conference (e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/mattlaschneider/lists/sts-people" >this list</a> of attendees at the Society for Textual Scholarship conference). Many users share public lists on their profile pages.</li>
<li>Intellectual leaders in your subfield(s): look up the authors of your favorite books, both academic and fiction. Hear about their latest thinking, give thoughtful responses to work they tweet.</li>

<li>Wolfram Alpha's <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/facebook/">extensive analysis of your Facebook data</a> is a good reminder of the information that can be put together from what you post.</li>
<li>Your students read your tweets. So do prospective employers. Assume everyone—your parents, your administrators, the professor who wrote that book you hate/love so much you're tweeting about it—is reading your tweets. People don't need to be following you to read your tweets (unless your account if locked; see below). Even if it isn't true that everyone's reading your tweets, thinking like this will help you write things you won't regret in the future. And the good side of everyone being on Twitter is that it's easier to get into a conversation with someone whose academic work you admire, or scholars thinking about the same questions from different campuses and countries.</li>
<li>Planning on making your social media accounts (or particular posts/tweets) private when job-seeking as an excuse to use them loosely now is a bad idea (unless your use of them is purely social and less than flattering... but in that case you might consider making them private all the time). Once you post a thing, various sites (e.g. Topsy) archive it and don't delete it even if you delete the original post/tweet; if someone retweets your tweet, that RT also lives on.</li>
<li>Don't lock your Twitter account unless you're not using it for professional reasons. Part of being on Twitter is having non-followers read your tweets (and by extension, hear about your work) and start following you/become part of your academic conversation.</li>
