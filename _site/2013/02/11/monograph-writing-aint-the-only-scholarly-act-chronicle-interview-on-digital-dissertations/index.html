<h1 class="title">Monograph Writing Isn't the Only Scholarly Act: Chronicle Interview on Digital Dissertations</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>I was interviewed about my digital humanities/digital dissertation work by Stacey Patton at <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em>: <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/The-Dissertation-Can-No-Longer/137215">here's a link</a> and some snippets on my work:</p>
<p><em>Amanda Visconti, a doctoral student in her third year at the University of Maryland at College Park, entered the graduate program in English with a background in Web development, information studies, and user testing.

<p><em><strong>"Digital editions do a lot of things, but I'm interested in making them more participatory, meaning that readers get an interactive, engaged experience instead of a passive reading experience,"</strong> Ms. Visconti says. "Producing a traditional, book-style dissertation wouldn't help me do the scholarly work I need to do. <strong>And it wouldn't present that work to others in a way they could test, use, and benefit from."</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Ms. Visconti, the Maryland student, says she has had to defend her decision to do a nontraditional dissertation to academics who don't seem to think that digital projects on their own are scholarly enough.
