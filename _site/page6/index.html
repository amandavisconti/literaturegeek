        Infinite Ulysses: Spring 2014 Tech Update

      </span>

    <p>As spring warms up and I'm rapidly approaching the halfway point for my dissertation, I realized I've been blogging basically all theory and design, neglecting a discussion of the tech choices I've been making. So: a quick update on the state of the participatory digital edition I've been designing and coding! (I'll blog some more in-depth posts about weekly tech work once summer begins and my full time belongs to the dissertation.)</p>
<p>I received a fellowship from my department to work full-time on the dissertation (starting in June). That full-time work (Full time, full time full time—as much as I love my job, can you tell I'm excited to devote the entire week for months to my project?), combined with the good place I'm at with my current tech stack, should result in some significant tasks finished by the end of August; I'll also be able to meet my goal of beginning alpha testing of the site this September. Additionally, I met with my awesomely supportive dissertation committee at the end of April to make sure we were on the same page as to what dissertation deliverables will look like at the time of my defense next spring, and everything seems to be on track (despite switching the core code off which I'm building the site).</p>
<h2><strong>What I've Been Working On</strong></h2>
<p>The last sixth months were devoted to wire-framing, blogging and working through every design challenge I could think of encountering, and reading up on existing work with digital editions and the online communities from which I'm drawing social mechanics (Reddit and StackExchange). I also set up an Islandora site on a VPS (virtual private server; like a web host, except in addition to managing your web files you manage the entire server as well), and spent some time customizing that and working with Modernist Commons' digital edition modules.</p>
<h2>Switch to Building Off Annotator.js</h2>
<p>I've moved from basing my site on Islandora plus Modernist Commons, to working on a straight Drupal 7 website (I'm keeping a close eye on developments of Drupal 8 so that I can upgrade the site when 8 takes over); as I mentioned <a href="/2014/04/07/islandorainstallnotes/" >in my post summing up what I learned about Islandora set-up</a>, the Modernist Commons platform is very promising, but relies on several technical requirements that cost a lot of effort to use properly/maintain (e.g. a second database for Fedora in addition to the Drupal database (Fedora in particular was a resource drain in both senses: taking up a lot of memory = paying for more memory on my virtual server.) ) to support features much needed by the digital editing community, but out of scope or not applicable to my current project (Modernist Commons will be great at supporting collections of editions that want to incorporate versioning, TEI, and RDF). Modernist Commons is a great project that I look forward to watching develop, and I encourage anyone interested in developing that type of scholarly edition to get in touch with their team.</p>
<p>So: I learned some really useful sysadmin-type things, and I'm comfortable with Islandora if I ever need it for a future project. The current tech suite for my project is much better streamlined, only requiring the code needed to run my specific project, making it easier for me to create a generic set of code so that others can easily spin up their own participatory digital edition like mine.</p>
<p>I'm now building off the Javascript Annotator code from the Open Knowledge Foundation; there's already a (limited, slightly buggy, but very useful) implementation of a Drupal module to port this code to Drupal usage and to allow storing annotations in the Drupal database. My goal for this month (May 2014) is to finesse how annotations are stored; they're already accessible in <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views" >Views</a>, but tags aren't stored with the annotations (meaning that tags you create on annotations are lost with each page refresh) and existing Drupal modules for upvoting and other social mechanics aren't able to act on the annotations.</p>
<h2>Summer Plans</h2>
<p>Once I address those two issues, I'll be set to spend my summer months (June through August) full-time on site theming, user workflows, and setting up another basic feature of the site: "curated" editions. (I should probably start calling these "custom" editions—I understand how some people have Strong Opinions about the use and misuse of "curation"—but I like the connotation of <em>thoughtful</em> gathering of annotations the word lends to the feature, so I'm being lazy about my diction).</p>
<p>Whatever I end up calling it, the “curation” feature will let users easily toggle on a set of tagged annotations so that custom versions of the edition (just with those tagged annotations) may be shared. For example, a professor could annotate all the appearances of books, letters, and other forms of writing in the text and use this as the basis of a discussion with her students; students could also create their “own” editions singly or in groups, either by presenting an edition with their own collected annotations, or a combination of annotations they’d written and curated from existing annotations on the site.</p>
<p>One nice thing about ironing out storage issues means that I can start inputting my own annotations of <em>Ulysses</em> and not worry about losing that effort; I'll also be able to provide a guarantee to early beta testers of the site that any annotations they create will be retained in the official release of the site (even if that means I need to export and import them after further tech changes).</p>
<h2>Theming</h2>
<p>I spent some time reading the docs and trying out several frameworks, from ones I was familiar with (I've used earlier versions of Zen and Omega before) and hadn't heard of before (Aurora):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/omega" >Omega</a> (too tied into using the GUI to customize the theme for me)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/aurora" >Aurora</a> (interesting, but not as widely used as Zen and therefore not as well documented)</li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/zen" >Zen</a> (accessible, good balance in amount of code and GUI-hand-holding between Aurora and Omega, and something I've used before)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm leaning toward building off Zen, but we'll see how things go as I start to work on mobile theming and figure out how to make the site as universally accessible as possible. In the weeks ahead, I'll be writing about how I'm incorporating usability and accessibility studies from other domains into my digital edition site design.</p>

        Affinity of ideas: Using an affinity wall to map out my digital dissertation
      </a>

    <p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram" >affinity wall (diagram, chart)</a> is a technique I picked up while doing some contextual inquiry consulting as part of my information master's. It's a way to take a bunch of separate ideas and visually map out how they're related (thus, "affinity"); this helps your areas of focus (or paper section headings) rise organically out of an overview of all the things you want to cover, rather than being pushed onto the ideas from the top down.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/affinityboard1.jpg" alt="The dry-erase board before I started (in the corner are topics I'd need to cover at the end of the project, after user testing)." width="300" height="199"> The dry-erase board before I started (in the corner are topics I'd need to cover at the end of the project, after user testing).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/44466253@N07/" >I first used affinity mapping</a> to figure out how a system (tech support ticketing software for a nursing department) actually worked, mapping my observations from being embedded in a workplace environment, instead of just relying on interviews and staff views on what they thought was going on. Now, I'm using it to figure out how all the things I want to think about and say as part of dissertation project can come together in one scholarly journal article. (<em>Note that photos are deliberately small, as I'm not completely comfortable with posting a detailed outline of an eventual journal article</em>.)</p>
<p><img src="/assets/affinityboard2.jpg" alt="Post-it notes grouped by topic on the affinity wall dry-erase board." width="300" height="372"> The first grouping of topics on the affinity board.</p>

<h2>How to Make an Affinity Wall</h2>
<p>The technique is simple: get a couple packs of post-it notes and an empty wall or board. Write down one idea per post-it, only using a few words (if you need more, you should probably break the thought into more post-it notes); you can use different colors of post-it if you want to keep track of some factor such as whether the idea came from an interview, an observation, a Twitter conversation, or a book. Once you've written everything out, start to group things together in ways that make sense, without trying to impose some pre-decided groupings on the ideas.</p>

<h2>Affinity Wall to Journal Article</h2>
<p>The actual dissertation deliverable for this article is only a polished draft; we're not tying its acceptance or publication into the evaluation process. I'm expecting to write sections that won't be submitted when I share the piece with a journal, so I tried not to think about whether there would be enough space to cover a topic in the final article; in the paper I share at my defense, I'll just flag any sections that will drop out before sending the article to a journal.</p>
<p>The affinity wall also covered content I needed to write that wouldn't fit in even the longest article: things I needed to think through via writing and research, and content I want on the site (e.g. a short background on Joyce and the writing of Ulysses, a moderation policy, and addressing the IP rights of site users). I bracketed on the side of the board any topics that would only appear as written content on the website not in the journal article) or for pieces I could only write after my user testing. This left me with nine main sections of writing and thinking that I can work on right now as I'm building the website. Once those nine topics were chosen, I was able to arrange the post-its beneath the headings in an order that makes narrative sense.</p>
<h2>Tackling the Writing</h2>
<p>My next step will be to mark every post-it that I've already begun to address. The point isn't to cross things off a list once I've blogged about them once. Rather, the wall lets me make certain I'm spending time thinking about all the major sections of the project; I mark a post-it note once (one diagonal line across) when I've thought and written enough about a topic that I've produced a blog post, and twice (making an X across the post-it square) when I've done enough work that my writing on the topic is ready for pulling into a draft of the journal article.</p>
<p>Here are the nine main sections I ended up with, in case they're hard to read on the photos (Again, these are deliberately non-zoomable as I'm not completely comfortable with showing the world a detailed outline of an article I'll be working on for the next year):</p>
<ol>
<li>Lit review and project precedents</li>
<li>Speculative experiment to practical outcome</li>
<li>Dissertation format and methodology</li>
<li>Tech decisions</li>
<li>"Edition"? (addressing what an edition is and if my website is one)</li>
<li>Metaphors for participatory editions (e.g. <a title="Living Editions: What Seminars Can Teach Us About Building Digital Editions" href="/2012/11/06/livingeditions/" >my post on classrooms as participatory editions</a>)</li>
<li>Inclusivity</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Learning from existing online communities (e.g. <a title="Cat GIFs & Mrkgnao: Ulysses, Reddit, and What Digital Editions Can Learn from Online Communities" href="/2013/07/29/redditulysses/" >my post on what digital editions can learn from Reddit and StackExchange</a>)</li>

    <p>Here's a quick, three-minute video about my dissertational project (<em>note: this video is now somewhat dated—it was created in April 2014, about a year before I finished the dissertation. The final Infinite Ulysses site is now available at <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">InfiniteUlysses.com</a>.</em>):</p>

<p>If you want to know more, <a title="My Digital Dissertation: Public Humanities, Participatory Design, and Infinite Ulysses" href="/2014/04/20/my-digital-dissertation-update/">the recent talk I gave at the Nebraska DH Forum</a> is pretty thorough, or you can <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com" >see the now completed dissertation project site</a>.</p>
<p><em>Here's a transcript of the video:</em></p>
<p>I’m designing, coding, and user-testing digital social reading interfaces for my literature doctoral dissertation. This is a novel approach; rather than write the traditional four-chapter monograph, my dissertation will consist of four pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Infinite Ulysses participatory digital edition website</li>
<li>Formal usability testing with volunteers reading Ulysses via my website</li>
<li>Research blogging on the process of scholarly building throughout the entire dissertation, and</li>
<li>A multimedia scholarly article</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm using the site to pursue three main research questions:</p>
<p>1. How can we design digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and non-academics in our love for the nuances of a text’s history and interpretation?</p>
<p>2. How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (things like upvoting and tagging) to create reading experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of user-generated annotation quantity but also quality?</p>
<p>3. What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like Ulysses—when a participatory digital edition places them under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?</p>
<p>Let's turn to discussing the site itself. Here's the simple version of what my edition will let scholars and readers do: read the text online on their laptop, iPad, or tablet; when they run into something in their reading, whether that's a question, or an interpretation or context they wish to share, or an answer for a question left by another reader, they'll be able to highlight that piece of the text and add that as an annotation, which will then show up to the side of the text (like marginalia). Readers can also add tags to these annotations and up- or down-vote them, as well as have the option to fill out user profiles with fields for research interests, whether you've read the text before, and other details to aid in site customization for each reader's interests, background, and reading habits.</p>
<p>I won't read through all the examples what the site will be able to do (you can <a title="Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition" href="/2013/06/25/iufeatures/" >read a full list on this blog post</a>), but here are a few examples of things you'll be able to do on the Infinite Ulysses site:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can filter the annotations on the novel to only show those notes on particular areas of interest to you (e.g. annotations that translate foreign words, or annotations aimed at first-time readers)</li>
<li>You can filter <em>out</em> annotations you don't want to see (e.g. spoilers about something that only becomes clear later in the book)</li>
<li>And, you can easily create your own customized reading edition of Ulysses that shows only annotations aimed at a specific topic (e.g. an edition meant for use by a class focusing on the place of books, letters, and other written material in the Modernist novel), and/or only see annotations added by specific users, such as members of your literature class or book club</li>
</ul>
