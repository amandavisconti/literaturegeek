        The Filter Problem at the CODEX Literary Hackathon

      </span>

    <p>I'm at <a href="http://codexhackathon.com/">the MIT Media Lab's CODEX Literary Hackathon</a> this weekend—an event focused on prototyping tools for the future of digital reading, books, libraries, and publishing. Below is my description of the annotation "filter problem", the research challenge that I'm bringing to the table at the event (although I might end up working on something else—we'll see!).</p>

<p><em>Update: I pitched "Team Annotation" and we ended up getting around ten people together to brainstorm annotation, before breaking into several smaller project teams. Read our Team Annotation notes <a href="https://hackdash.org/projects/568ff7e062b2cc5d050af6c8">here</a> and see what I ended up hacking on <a href="https://hackdash.org/projects/5692943e62b2cc5d050af71e">here</a>.</em></p>

<P><h2>Better online communities and the “filter problem”</h2><br>
Making “internet comments”, web annotation, and other types of online communal knowledge-making not terrible means balancing our inability to read everything (all the comments on a topic) with a desire to defeat the echo-chamber effect of Facebook-style algorithmic personalization based on what we like/favorite the most, which isn't a good fit for reading and learning—we want to hear differing interpretations and ideas that challenge and unsettle us, rather than get a smooth Facebook experience. I'm interested in code and design work addressing the need for nuanced information filtering, balancing digital fixes like mechanics for crowdsourcing curation & moderation with community design solutions like interfaces that scaffold good digital citizenship.</p>

<p>I ran my first test of these ideas about balancing algorithmic and community curation of public discussion by building <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">InfiniteUlysses.com</a>, experimenting with crowd commentary around a notoriously difficult novel and rejuvenating a platform traditionally aimed only at scholars (the digital edition) via social mechanics used on sites like Reddit and StackExchange. My design both supported social textual annotation, and also personalized (at a very basic level) the display of the resulting huge quantity of public-authored annotations to fit each reader's needs and background. Our filtering work could be on the Infinite Ulysses site itself, elsewhere using Infinite Ulysses' code, or something else entirely.</p> 

<p><img alt="Front page screenshot of InfiniteUlysses.com" src="/assets/3-7-2015_FrontScreenshot.png"><em>Reddit + Ulysses, anyone?</em></p>

<p>This weekend, might we experiment with balancing both coded mechanics and social curation to give people better reading experiences: a non-overwhelming amount of annotations per page, tuned to their interests, background, and needs? Some steps we could start to brainstorm and prototype:
<ol>
<li>brainstorm more ways of filtering annotations than by date, author, popularity, and popularity of the author's other annotations, then</li>
<li>think about how we can make it easy and enjoyable for readers to add the metadata allowing this additional annotation filtering.</li>
<li>Someone interested in algorithmic learning might draft a questionnaire that guesses the filters a given reader might want applied to their experience.</li>
<li>Someone interested in community design could work on a set of best practices for reading sites to implement before inviting social annotation (e.g. how to seed the annotations with model commentary).</li>
</ol></p>

<p>I'm also especially interested in anything related to annotation, social reading, and communities designed around various types of "difficult" text (challenging to read, politically contentious, requiring deep field or historical knowledge to understand...)</p>

        The future of a thing is a return to its values

<a href="/tag/digital-humanities">digital humanities</a>,
      

<a href="/tag/textual-scholarship">textual scholarship</a>
      </span>

    <p><h2>I keep pulling the same tool out of my bag this year: does <strong>the thing we've built</strong> match <strong> the values behind why we built it?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Must</em> a dissertation have written chapters?</strong> (<em>No.</em>) Or is the value of a dissertation that it lets you practice and prove the values and skills your scholarly field needs its members to share, and are there other methods for doing that than writing a proto-monograph? (<em>Easy answer: yes & yes, see my example at <a href="http://Dr.AmandaVisconti.com">Dr.AmandaVisconti.com</a></em>)</li>
<li><strong><em>Must</em> a digital edition focus on the same methods as a scholarly print edition?</strong> Recension, conjecture, work at the word-level (or below) of a text are key methods for many scholarly editors, but work that pushes the field of textual scholarship ahead can also look like <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/ulysses/">a museum exhibit</a>, <a href="http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/264/329">iPad app</a>, or <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/">experimental code</a>: what matters is attention to the core values of textual scholarship, like clearly arguing for your methodology, establishing the authority of your text, etc. (see <a href="http://dr.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf">Section 4: Reimagining Editions in my recent whitepaper</a> for lots more plus real examples!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Separating original values from how they ended up manifested—and not making the mistake that the final artifact is the same thing as the originating values—has been a productive thought experiment for me this year. (Of course, I don't ignore questions about how those "originating values" came together in the first place, and how they might be altered or replaced for the better...)</p>

<p>Dr. Jennifer Steenshorne just distributed a short survey on the future of scholarly editions via the <a href="http://dhhumanist.org/">HUMANIST listserv</a>; you can contribute to the survey yourself <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XXPZWNH">here</a>! She writes that the survey is for a round table discussion at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Historical Association, "<a href="https://aha.confex.com/aha/2016/webprogram/Session13356.html">Documentary Editors Engage the 21st Century</a>".</p>

<p>Since the survey got me to summarize some thinking about digital editions vs. scholarly digital editions over the past year, I share my answers here as well. All question headings are from Dr. Steenshorne's survey.</p>

<p><h3>"How do you define a digital scholarly edition?"</h3><br>
I think using "scholarly digital edition" (SDE) for something that digitally approximates a scholarly print edition is useful for our community: we want an easy way of calling out when the same (or digital counterparts of) scholarly activities of versioning, recension, word-level decisions, etc. are involved.</p>
<p><strong>Differently</strong>, a <em>digital edition* to me</em> is a broader category sitting above the SDE, meaning *any* digital work (site, performance, museum exhibit) that show it values the same values motivating scholarly editing activities as an SDE, but possibly in different and often experimental ways: that is, imagining other means of manifesting textual scholarship's core values (authority, clearly defined and discussed methodology...). Unlike a scholarly digital edition, digital editions are a more open term allowing scholar-creators to experiment with new ways of manifesting these core field values.</p>

<p><h3>"What are the most useful buzz words or concepts (like Big Data) in digital humanities, particularly for scholarly digital editions?"</h3><br>
Public literature, participatory edition/archive, citizen scholars, meaningful crowdsourcing, linked open data, exportable data, web annotation. I'd like to see more room for discussions of textual materiality, screen essentialism, e-lit and artistic design, interface design, user testing and usability, audiences, diversity (what authors get edition projects funded & popular; who makes editions and who gets the credit; the audiences for which editions get made).</p>

<p><h3>"What are the most annoying or overused buzz words or concepts (like Big Data) in digital humanities, particularly for scholarly digital editions?"</h3><br>
(<em>Aside: I like and understand what this question is asking, but I'm a tiny bit uncomfortable with IDing "buzz words", as thinking of something as "buzzwordy" is an easy way to dismiss it instead of at least acknowledge that someone is thinking critically about it, and it probably has a history of critical thought stretching back way before it became popular enough for people not involved in it to randomly hear about it (e.g. I'm a digital humanist, and I've both seen others dismiss DH as a buzzword, and encountered people actually using it as a buzzword "the funders will want to see us include"). I know it's shorthand for "I wish we'd talk about this thing more too/instead if time is limited", but shorthand isn't the most useful thing if it has a high misfire rate for interpretation... so it's something I want to notice and be careful about using myself.)</em></p>
<p>But things I wish we'd talk about more—and on the flip side, the concepts I think distract from the discussions I wish we were having? I'd like to see more room for discussions of textual materiality, screen essentialism, e-lit and artistic design, interface design, user testing and usability, audiences, diversity (what authors get edition projects funded & popular; who makes editions and who gets the credit; the audiences for which editions get made).</p>
<p>I've moved from TEI/textual markup to work focused on the things I listed above, so sometimes I'm sad when a conversation about digital textual scholarship means a discussion solely focused on markup instead of also including other aspects of textual scholarship, <em>but</em> on the other hand I'm extremely privileged and happy that such strong work on textual encoding exists and continues, and that I feel like I can focus on other aspects of a textual project knowing this area of textual work has both a past and a rich present of strong exploration.</p>

<p><h3>"What are some of the most exciting new scholarly digital edition projects you have seen and why?"</h3><br>
<ol><li>The <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/sc/oxford/frankenstein/volume/i#/p1">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a> is doing interesting work in involving editors at different stages of expertise (from students on up) and signaling to users what degree of quality a given set of markup guarantees (instead of hiding everything from public use until it's all 100% checked by a professional editor).</li>
<li>The SHORE consortium is bringing together a number of key scholarly editors, edition developers, and scholarly period societies so that when one edition develops a new tool (e.g. Infinite Ulysses' social annotation), all participating editions will share the same technical backend and can therefore also use the new tool. Additionally, we'll start to gather a dataset of both scholarly and public literary annotations across the literary periods (medieval, modern, Victorian...) and be able to learn new things about digital reading and research. The first example site fully migrated into SHORE is <a href="http://CoveCollective.org">CoveCollective.org</a> (currently under alpha testing, but there's a consortium meeting and public talks at Purdue in May 2016).</li>
<li>The <a href="http://ride.i-d-e.de/">RIDE digital edition review journal</a> is building scholarly review for SDEs that is aware of technical and design work as a critical component.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">InfiniteUlysses.com</a> uniquely invites the public into the critical conversation around James Joyce's challenging novel Ulysses via user-authored social annotation. Additionally, the edition experiments with mechanics for social curation and moderation of the annotations, and attempts to personalize the annotations displayed to each reader's expertise, needs, and interests.</li>
<li><a href="http://dr.amandavisconti.com">My recent digital dissertation</a> was based around this project—<a href="http://dr.amandavisconti.com">"'How can you love a work, if you don't know it?': Critical Code and Design toward Participatory Digital Editions"</a> used entirely digital humanities methods (design, code, blogging, user testing) to create and analyze various theories about public and social digital editions (especially those supporting social annotation).</li>
<li>To explain why <a href="InfiniteUlysses.com">InfiniteUlysses.com</a> is a digital edition but <em>not</em> a scholarly digital edition, part of <a href="http://dr.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf">my whitepaper on the Infinite Ulysses project and dissertation around it</a> deals directly with a number of edition and edition-like objects (<a href="http://dr.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf">PDF link</a> and see Section 4: Reimagining Editions).</li>
</ol></p>

<p><h3>"What would you like to see more of in scholarly digital editions?"</h3><br>
Things related to making our hard scholarly effort reach people outside the professoriate (editions for new students, for new readers; a more public literature, enabled by textual scholarship plus digital humanities), and to making sure that work lasts in an accessible form beyond the next decade.</p>

        Introducing Static Sites for Digital Humanities Projects (why & what are Jekyll, GitHub, etc.?)

    <p>I'm working with my university press on new models for DH scholarship... and as I started typing up a description of using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and GitHub for a proposed DH book project, I ended up discussing not just Jekyll and GitHub but also defining static vs. dynamic sites, git and versioning, and GitHub pages.</p><p>Thought I'd share this as a starting point for others! (<em>Caveat emptor: this is one of those emails that turned into a huge email that turned into a blog post.</em>) If you want to be superfancy, you can click <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://literaturegeek.com/2015-12-08-WhyJekyllGitHub/">this link to annotate the page with questions and requests for clarification, comments, and suggestions</a> using the magic of <a href="https://hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a>, and I'll work on refining this into a more exhaustive FAQ as time allows.</p>

<h2>What are.... dynamic versus static websites?</h2>
<p>Dynamic sites (like Drupal or WordPress) pull information from a database to populate a page; when you search for some words on Amazon.com, for example, the search results page you are shown didn’t already exist as a full HTML page—Amazon.com has a template for search results page with things they all share like their main menu and logo, but it queries the database to insert the results of that search you initiated. Jekyll is a “static site generator” in that it takes page templates (those things like main menus and footers, shared across all the web pages) and other files with specific information (e.g. a file for each blog post on the site) and combines these into full HTML pages for the site visitors to see (i.e. generating a static site, aka a folder of HTML files)—and these are already put together and ready to serve up when you're visiting the site. That is, Jekyll doesn’t need to do anything like querying a database when you visit a page; it’s already got the pages fully formed, and it just updates them when and if they ever change. (For someone who took more time to think through a metaphor for static site generation, <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators">check out this post</a>!)</p>

<h2>How is Jekyll like Drupal/WordPress/Omeka/[other CMS]?</h2>
<p>Jekyll is like software called content management systems (CMSs) such as Drupal or WordPress in that it’s a set of code that makes a website run and handles certain repeated tasks like displaying a logo and menubar on every page, creating a searchable archive of blog posts, etc. Unlike CMSs, though, Jekyll doesn’t have a web “dashboard” (that shiny UI you use to administrate the website: moderating comments, writing a blog post from within the live site...). And! Jekyll does not use a database (the source of a lot of code and security headaches in CMSs like Drupal). If you don’t need the power and possibilities behind these CMSs, it’s often better for effort, security, and preservation not to use them. Or if you <em>need</em> some of the things that Jekyll particularly offers...</p>

<h2>Why/when Jekyll?</h2>
<p>Versioning! Security (no database hacking) and less sysadminy hassle in general. Speed of loading pages. Free and easy to set up and host with GitHub Pages, and it's then linked into the GitHub.com ecosystem of code versioning, sharing, and reuse.</p>

<p>Jekyll doesn’t work as well if you have a site like Amazon.com that basically lets visitors create a huge number of custom pages by making complex searches from a huge set of things, since it’s easier for Amazon.com to create search result pages on the fly from their database than to store an HTML page for each possible search result combination. But for a site where you can largely imagine now what all the pages will look like (e.g. a digital book), Jekyll is faster, lighter, and better for longterm security and preservation.</p>

<h2>GitHub.com, git, and repos</h2>
<p>GitHub.com is a site where people share code they’ve written so others can reuse it, build on it, and report bugs and feature requests. It’s based on git, which is software for versioning code: keeping track of the various changes in code over time as people add, subtract, and otherwise edit that text. People use GitHub.com for things other than code including blogging and professional writing, since it supports keeping track of multiple versions of a text and is friendly to collaboratively authored text. (Other sites besides GitHub use git, and you can use git without GitHub.com. GitHub.com is just a wildly popular public platform for sharing and working on versioned code.)</p>

<p>GitHub “repos" (repositories) are just collections of code; for example, I have <a href="https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-dissertation">one repo with all the code involved in my dissertation</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/amandavisconti/EncodedCurtain">another repo that shares an old Omeka maintenance-page hack I wrote</a>. </p>

<h2>GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages can be located for free at a GitHub subdomain such as amandavisconti.github.io/SGAPedagogyPage (where amandavisconti is my GitHub username and SGAPedagogyPage is the name of the GitHub repository holding its web files). You can also purchase from elsewhere and use your own domain name with the same site (as I did for LiteratureGeek.com). Custom domain names aren’t permanently bought, so you need to renew your license over them from time to time (you can do this once a year or buy a bunch of years at a time; the type of domain names a DHer might want to acquire usually cost around $10-20 each per year... except if you want DH.center, they will overcharge you for that!).</p>

<p>You don’t need to use GitHub or GitHub pages to use Jekyll; you could, for example, use commercial or university web hosting. I like GitHub Pages hosting because it’s free, uses git (which manages multiple versions and drafts of collaboratively authored/edited texts nicely), is set up to make Jekyll use easier, and because GitHub is already the most popular place for DH data sharing, code and text versioning, etc.</p>

<h2>Can I use these for projects that might have a commercial aspect (e.g. a book series with digital components)?</h2>
<p>I think so. Jekyll is free and open-source. <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Its code</a> can be used for commercial projects (<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE">its MIT License file</a> with its attribution to the Jekyll creator should be kept with the rest of the files). </p>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> are webpages hosted for free on GitHub.com. GitHub Pages can run Jekyll. My <a href="http://www.LiteratureGeek.com">LiteratureGeek.com research blog</a> is an example of a site using Jekyll to run the site and GitHub Pages to host the site. According to this page, commercial use of GitHub Pages is allowed, though because GitHub retains the right to alter that, anyone using it in a book project should have a backup plan in place (something very simple: time required, who to contact, cost of transferring to university or commercial web hosting).</p>
<p>If you do begin to use GitHub for multiple DH projects, you’ll want to look into their various plans, as the default free plans are set up for individual use and public repositories (e.g. you might want multiple private repositories so sites can be developed there before going public). There are various options including free plans for educational and non-profit uses.</p>

<p><em>There you have it, an only slightly-cleaned-up email turned into a blog post! It isn't meant to be a universal resource, but feel free to comment/suggest using <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://literaturegeek.com/2015-12-08-WhyJekyllGitHub/">Hypothesis via this link</a>.</em></p>
