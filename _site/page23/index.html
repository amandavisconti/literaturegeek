<div></div>
<p>THATCamp Games, the late-January four-day unconference on digital humanities and gaming, had its origin in <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/trevorandmarjee/5797536358/">a packed “humanities gaming” catch-all session</a> at THATCamp Prime 2011, where we quickly realized that “games” was too broad a topic for a single session. THATCamp Games brought together members of the games industry, games researchers and designers, and games teachers to discuss games in as many genres (e.g. board games, alternate reality games, video games) and areas (e.g. games for teaching writing, game programming, and historical gaming) as possible. Almost one hundred people attended, coming from both the local DC/MD area and states across the country: Washington, California, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, to name a few.</p>
<p>Our first event was one of the first screenings of Lorien Green’s new documentary <a href="http://www.boardgamemovie.com"><em>Going Cardboard</em></a>, a documentary about the players and designers in the burgeoning eurogaming scene; after the film showing, Green answered questions via Skype.</p>
<p>Friday offered a full day of <a href="http://thatcampgames.org/bootcamps/">fifteen workshops</a> ("Bootcamps") divided into three tracks: beginner-friendly introductions to game design (e.g. a “my first board game” prototyping session), a “hack track” for people with some previous game coding experience (e.g. HTML5, Inform 7, and the Kinect), and a track devoted to games in the classroom (e.g. alternate reality games and video games in the classroom). After the workshops, we headed over to MITH (<a href="http://ow.ly/i/qiU7">avoiding the grue</a>) for a reception.</p>

</div>
<p>Saturday started off menacingly: an overnight snowstorm left sheets of black ice between attendees and the conference. Most of the attendees and all of the coffee managed to make it to the conference building on time, however, and we cast our votes to narrow down almost forty attendee-proposed sessions to fit into five time slots in five rooms. (If you’re not familiar with <a href="http://thatcamp.org/">THATCamps</a>, attendees don’t present papers but instead write blog posts about topics they’d like to discuss, then facilitate sessions on those topics). You can see which sessions got placed on the schedule <a href="http://thatcampgames.org/fullchedule/">here</a>; these included discussions on <a href="http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/03/session-proposal-quest-based-evaluation-schemes/">quest-based evaluation schemes</a>, teaching <a href="http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/20/session-proposal-games-and-the-literature-classroom/">games in the literature classroom</a>, and <a href="http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/03/a-modest-session-proposal/">course game design using learning management systems</a>. We ran a game lounge all-day on Saturday, but since most attendees were busy with sessions then, we also met for game-playing and a Glorious-Trainwrecks-style rapid-prototyping game design jam on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>If you weren’t following the overwhelming volume of “#thatcamp games” tweets at the end of last month, we’re happy to report that the event satisfied both unconference novices and THATCamp veterans, with assessments such as “a truly intellectually (and personally) meaningful event” and “THATCamp Games: totally awesome." Amidst the sessions, we ran an unconference-long alternate reality game, participated as a group in a spoken text adventure, logged onto an attendee-run Minecraft server, and thought really hard about the puzzle on the backs of the conference shirts. If you’re sad you missed the event, we’re collecting names of potential future attendees via a sidebar form on <a href="http://thatcampgames.org">thatcampgames.org</a>.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://thatcampgames.org/">THATCamp Games</a> was co-organized by MITH Webmaster <a href="http://www.AmandaVisconti.com/">Amanda Visconti</a> and <a href="http://selfloud.net/">Anastasia Salter</a>. Follow us on Twitter via @thatcampgames or #thatcamp games.<br>

    <p><em>Cross-posted from the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/book-hacking-primer/">Technoromanticism Seminar Blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>I spent my bus ride home thinking about what it might mean to hack a book. I've seen beautiful sculptures made out of books (like these: <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/12/23/guy-laramees-books.html">one</a> <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/09/12/anonymous-paper-sculptures-in-scotlands-libraries.html">two</a> <a href="http://boingboing.net/2009/03/19/brian-dettmers-book-1.html">three</a> <a href="http://boingboing.net/2009/06/17/nicholas-galanins-bo.html">four</a>) as well as more readable, but still fundamentally remixing acts of book hacking in the form of "altered books" like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humument"><em>A Humument</em></a> and Jonathan Safran Froer's deliberately altered <a href="http://www.gearfuse.com/hacking-the-app-called-the-book/"><em>The Tree of Codes</em></a>. Even more than book art, however, thinking about designing digital editions of paper books has helped me start noticing the individual mechanics of the vehicle, and it feels like outlining just what a book <em>does</em> is a good step toward making it do things it "shouldn't" (i.e. hacking). Although we're not talking about digital literature yet, it could be useful to contrast books on-screen and off if we want to start pointing to what makes a book work (or, you can check out this "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdkucf6wxU4">Medieval Help Desk</a>" video and think about the happy differences between scroll and book!).</p>
<p>Matt Kirschenbaum's article “<a href="http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/bookscapes.pdf">Bookscapes: Modeling Books in Electronic Space</a>”* argues that contrasting books with their on-screen counterparts helps us call out the specific features important to the analog form because "books on the screen are not books, they are models of books"--and a model is made to be hacked and analyzed. Matt's article offers a nice starting point for thinking about the features of books, identifying five affordances specific to the book:</p>
<ol>
<li>simultaneous random access and sequential ordering,</li>
<li>volumetric (three-dimensional) storage space,</li>
<li>finity/boundedness,</li>
<li>the comparative possibilities offered by two facing pages (think of Folger student Shakespeare editions), and</li>
<li>writeability (who hasn't wished they could jot down notes on the PDF they're reading online?).</li>
</ol>
<p>As we look at how Blake hacks the book, can we add to Matt's list of book affordances? In addition to broad characteristics, we might list specific elements such as the datedness of page numbering on the Nook or the (un?)necessary pause when "flipping" pages on a Kindle. Why were these technologies useful in books, and awkward (or nostalgic) in e-books?</p>

    <p>Last month, I released the first version of a new digital text project: <a href="http://www.digitaldospassos.com">Digital Dos Passos</a>.</p>
<p>John Dos Passos' <em>U.S.A.</em> trilogy is a text particularly ripe for a digital treatment. No other work combines so many references to media with so little interpretive framing of this media (in Sartre's words, “the style of a statement to the Press"; 66). The <em>U.S.A.</em> trilogy style is not only removed and declarative, but patchworked; when asked what sort of plan he had for <em>U.S.A.</em> when he began writing it, Dos Passos replied:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I was trying to develop... the idea of montage. I had tried it out in Manhattan Transfer—using pieces of popular songs. By the time it evolved into such compartments as the camera eye of the U.S.A. trilogy it served a useful function—which in that case was to distill my subjective feelings about the incidents and people described. My hope was to achieve the objective approach of a Fielding, or a Flaubert... In the biographies, in the newsreels, and even the narrative, I aimed at total objectivity by giving conflicting views—using the camera eye as a safety valve for my own subjective feelings. It made objectivity in the rest of the book much easier. </em>(Sanders)</p>
<p>The <em>U.S.A.</em> trilogy is thus a "montage" of media, of events, and of people. The novels combine the frequency of pop culture name-checking in Don DeLillo's <em>White Noise</em> with a popular consciousness long gone from living readers; the datedness of <em>U.S.A.</em>'s setting complicates an analog reading, but eases a digital presentation by placing most of its references in the public domain.</p>
<p>The goal for the <a href="http://www.DigitalDosPassos.com">Digital Dos Passos</a> digital text is a site offering immersive engagement with the <em>U.S.A</em>. trilogy's media; photography, video, audio, digitized newspapers, and other historical <img title="Digital Dos Passos" alt="Screenshot of the http://www.DigitalDosPassos.com website" src="/assets/ddp.jpg" width="300" height="244">media, as well as short textual annotations, will alert readers to the events and people to which Dos Passos' media references point. I began my exploration of Dos Passos' use of media with the Newsreels in the trilogy's middle novel, <em>1919</em>. The Newsreels' discrete references to the media vehicles of popular culture (conceivable as separate fragments or items) are free of both commentary and narrative framing, a characteristic making the Newsreels both the easiest section to annotate and (because of their lack of commentary) the section most in need of such a digital treatment.</p>
<p>In terms of what's next, I'll be spending the spring term focusing on design and theory: presenting papers and submitting articles on several aspects of the project (which is especially rich because of my trine interests in complex Modernist novels, hypertext theory, and web design), as well as improving the site's interface to make it a more immersive experience. I plan to resume adding content to the site this summer, possibly with the assistance of other interested graduate students.</p>
