        <title>The Digital Humanities Slack &amp; Community Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Come join the Digital Humanities Slack, a set of DHy chatrooms! (Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;tinyurl.com/DHslack&lt;/a&gt; to join.) &lt;strong&gt;We are open to anyone&lt;/strong&gt; with a curiosity about DH and/or related interests (e.g. digital libraries, museums, and archives). Absolutely no expertise needed, and we have several specific chat rooms (called “channels” on Slack) devoted to DH beginners, students, job seekers, and asking all kinds of DHy and digital methods questions. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users&quot;&gt;Here’s a good overview of what Slack is/how to use it&lt;/a&gt;. I’m happy to answer questions about how to use Slack or what it is via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dh-slack-stats&quot;&gt;DH Slack stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH Slack was created in October 2015 after a suggestion from Ed Summers, and was built by the channel creation and chatting of its members. Nine months later (as of July 6, 2016), we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;700 members (84% of which have used the Slack over the past two weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;67 “channels” (chat rooms devoted to specific topics)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;21.3k messages sent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About 60% of messages are on public channels, with the other 40% being DMs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;180 files (shared code, documents, screenshots…) have been shared and stored on the Slack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matthew Lincoln set up Slack loading screen messages to quote definitions of DH from a variety of practitioners! And when someone types “what is the digital humanities”, a bot should respond by pointing you to the 800+ definitions over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com&quot;&gt;whatisdigitalhumanities.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Channels (chat rooms) are Slack user-created, and the names of channels are represented with a pound sign and no space (#wordlefans). The current channels include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socializing and community info:&lt;/strong&gt; #introductions (share a little about your DH interests and what you do, or let people know about a new channel you created), #conferences, #off-topic (water cooler space for non-DHy chat and GIFs), #jobs, #announcements (events, CFPs, new projects), #hottopic (chat about current general DH issues, like that LARB piece…), #reading (share recent DH and entertainment reading and discuss books), #weeklies (weekly fun themes/survey questions)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional and language channels:&lt;/strong&gt; #dh-california, #dh_humanidadesdigital, #dh-tennessee, #dh-bay-area, #dh-baltimore&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fields:&lt;/strong&gt; #libraries, #dh-archives, #museums, #publichistory, #arthistory, #envirohumanities, #mediastudies, #elit, #publishing, #openaccess, #copyright&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting started:&lt;/strong&gt; #DHanswers (both pulls from the DH Q&amp;amp;A site, and a space for asking new questions), #students (talk about the experience of being a student, doing DH as a student…), #beginners (welcoming space for those just getting started in DH), #tutorialplease (ask for pointers to good tutorials on something you want to learn) and #tutorials (share useful tutorials as you run across them)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific DH methods and practices:&lt;/strong&gt; #methodology, #visualization, #data-sharing, #annotation (plus a channel specifically about #hypothes-is annotation), #geospatial, #networks, #coding, #design, #linkeddata, #bots, #crowdsourcing, #gaming, #linux, #machinelearning, #databases, #physcomp, #topicmodel, #bibliography, #textencoding, #texthacking, #textanalysis, #datacuration, #philosophy, #simulation, #music, #sound, #3dscholarship, #codesnippets&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching/learning:&lt;/strong&gt; #teachingDH, #digitalpedagogy, #programminghistorian (for discussions around the DH tutorial website)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And #meta&lt;/strong&gt; (to discuss the DH Slack itself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-design-decisions&quot;&gt;Community design decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is a comparatively new platform (vs. Twitter), so DHers are still figuring out how it can be useful and how to best run the DH Slack. Anyone can join the DH Slack (&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;tinyurl.com/DHslack&lt;/a&gt;) and then visit the #meta channel to participate in decisions about our community design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who shared thoughts on improving the DH Slack on the Slack, via email, or on Twitter, including DH Slack members Sam Abrams, Kristen Mapes, Matthew Lincoln, Ed Summers, Alan G. Pike, Liz Lorang, Hyperverses, timfinnegan, Jeremy Throne, Brandon Locke, Lincoln Mullen, Brian Croxall, and Micah Vandegrift, and others via Twitter and email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;After community discussion, we’re keeping the DH Slack as ephemeral (no longterm archive of all messages) and not allowing people who aren’t signed into the Slack to read it. I’d be happy to chat with and amplify the platform of anyone who wants to make a DH Slack alternative that does either/both of these things, and I agree that it would be nice to have a place where Twitter conversations could be comfortably and publicly expanded (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://Hypothes.is&quot;&gt;Hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; annotation?)—it’s just that the place to do that right now isn’t the DH Slack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the issues we’ve been thinking through. I’ve heard reasonable arguments for public readability and/or archiving from people who haven’t been using the Slack. Hearing from non-Slacker users is good, since we want to be careful about decisions that deter others from joining; on the other hand, submitting feedback after using this Slack shows both an understanding of how people have been using it, and buy-in to the outcome of these decisions. (That’s what my thinking has been in weighing input from inside and outside the Slack.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code of conduct&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/DHslack/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md&quot;&gt;Our evolving code of conduct lives here&lt;/a&gt;, and Slack members are encouraged to suggest additions or changes via #meta. To summarize, we’re dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, with a particular reminder that dismissing or belittling lack of DH, tech, or other experience (e.g. answering questions with links to Let Me Google That For You) is not allowed. We provide a list with specific examples of what constitutes harassment and a statement on handling of “reverse-isms”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public reading.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to Sava Saheli for pointing out that the problem with moving unwieldy Twitter conversations to the DH Slack is that this adds a barrier to public reading not present on Twitter (anyone can sign up for the DH Slack and start using it right away, but you do need to sign up and know how to navigate Slack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Slack and the self-hosted OS Slack alternative Mattermost (that I’ll discuss below) don’t allow non-signed-in (public) reading. Our workaround would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdlincoln/jekyll-slack&quot;&gt;Matthew Lincoln’s nice solution for exporting Slack messages to a GitHub Pages-hosted Jekyll website&lt;/a&gt;. This would require someone to remember to periodically manually export the Slack’s messages and upload them to GitHub, and I’m not sure if our 10k message limit would cause a problem (each export would be missing earlier messages, so new exports to GitHub might overwrite old ones, meaning older messages would disappear from the public site–insofar as anything disappears from the web given Internet Archive, screenshots, etc.). One option would be to only export certain channels that are visibly marked as public-readable, rather than exporting the entire DH Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed whether allowing public reading this way would make people more or less comfortable using the DH Slack, reaching out both on the DH Slack to active users, and on Twitter to inactive users and people who haven’t joined the DH Slack. I heard more people as neutral or against making any of the DH Slack publicly readable this way, making me think we shouldn’t pursue it for now. A twice-cited reason was that a code of conduct is useful when applied not just to people writing on the Slack, but to people reading it as well; if only signed-in people can read the DH Slack, then we can block anyone who harasses from continuing to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Message archive.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re at 21.3k Slack messages, and Slack limits its free plan users to seeing the most recent 10k messages. We discussed whether we should pursue a plan that gives us access to the full archive of messages (or come up with a hack to preserve these on our own, like Matthew Lincoln’s solution discussed above). I heard more people who were neutral or against doing this, so we won’t do it. One cited reason was that ephemerality was freeing: people tend to use the Slack as a place for informal chat, memes, and gifs as well as scholarship, and knowing you’re on the record for whatever you say has a chilling effect on that use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack alternative?&lt;/strong&gt; Micki Kaufman suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost&quot;&gt;Mattermost&lt;/a&gt; as a Slack alternative: Mattermost is open-source, not run by a for-profit company, self-hosted, and has a tool to import users from Slack. I think this is a really promising platform, and if we were back in October I’d probably have tried it first before Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a couple reasons, we’re not moving the DH Slack to Mattermost—but anyone is welcomed to set up their own Mattermost install on their servers and create a DH community. I’d happily advertise such as platform on the DH Slack! One reason we’re not moving right now is buy-in: people already use Slack for other teams (work, participating in project discussions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wk0JdF2Cty2VHMqpf_QlJXVKQdUtfeeFhaYRben3qaM/viewform&quot;&gt;Documenting the Now’s awesome chatroom around social media archiving ethics&lt;/a&gt;) and can move between those and the DH Slack in the same app, instead of having an additional platform open. We’re at 700 members, so although the Mattermost user import tool sounds very useful, we’d need to secure permission and interest from our users to move to that platform, and when this possibility was raised, no one was interested in moving. Someone would also need to provide the web hosting and be willing to maintain and upgrade the installation longterm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DH scholarly organization oversight?&lt;/strong&gt; We originally approached a DH scholarly organization about sponsoring the DH Slack because doing so would let us use Slack’s free non-profit plan, which gives you access to a permanent archive of all your Slack’s messages (the free Slack plan we’re using now only gives you access to the last 10k messages, although it doesn’t delete the hidden messages—you can get access back by upgrading your plan). Just paying for a Slack plan (even with the education discount) is cost-prohibitive as cost is calculated by number of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided to no longer seek sponsorship for the Slack non-profit plan, but we’re still discussing other ways the DH scholarly organization might sponsor or collaborate with the DH Slack. The way Slack forces one person with super admin privileges to “own” a Slack team is weird and undemocratic in our case, when this Slack exists and thrives because of all its members. I think it would still be worth considering a DH scholarly organization being involved just to help with moderation, and to prevent my using my admin privileges to replace all messages with Hamilton memes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hamiltonisawesome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Facebook post: &amp;quot;Washington: we are outgunned! outmanned! Hamilton: I have 3 friends if that helps&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, though, it isn’t good for one person to control something with so many members (even assuming my good intentions and trying to mitigate personal biases, I could e.g. be hit by a bus). DH scholarly organization involvement could just mean the organization would let members know about the Slack, but another option could be having a couple people from the organization (possibly from its communications committee) who would explicitly commit to helping with moderation/code of conduct issues if they arise. We might even switch the Slack “owner” to an account that several explicit moderators could use, instead of it just being my personal account, so the community can continue without resting on a single person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribute:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been trying to synthesize the discussions around these issues, and it’s very possible we’re missing some issues or that my biases are making me interpret people’s responses wrong. Please feel free to tell me so via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;—your name won’t be shared with anyone unless you want it to be. Or if you disagree or think of more reasons why we should reconsider these choices, please let me know! Finally, this isn’t a binding decision—we can definitely revisit these questions at any time in the future as issues arise or the Slack evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Humanities Dissertation Defense Talk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/2016/06/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk/&quot;&gt;DH Now Editors’ Choice post&lt;/a&gt;! (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dh-now/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for more Literature Geek posts highlighted by DH Now.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/14/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-advice&quot;&gt;made a few comments about the dissertation defense process in a previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, and here I’ll blog the actual defense talk. I’m even resisting the urge to edit and improve (although I’ve learned a lot about slide design and public speaking in the past year…). So, this post is a good representation of the actual defense talk I gave on April 14, 2015. If you’ve seen me present on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; in the past year, some pieces of this may be familiar…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I didn’t go back into the talk text and insert full citations, but anything I mention can be found in the bibliography of my dissertation whitepaper at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;dr.amandavisconti.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;Dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; is also the &lt;strong&gt;actual dissertation&lt;/strong&gt;, if you’d like to learn more about the full project (it is not the website for the dissertation—it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the dissertation!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you didn’t see &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/14/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-advice&quot;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt;: I recently realized that although &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;I thoroughly blogged my dissertation (almost 40 blog posts)&lt;/a&gt; and wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2015/05/09/dissertationdefended&quot;&gt;a post after successfully defending the dissertation in April 2015&lt;/a&gt;, I never blogged my actual defense talk. In keeping with &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;blogging the job talk&lt;/a&gt; that took me into my current job, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/grad-advice/&quot;&gt;other DH/grad student advice&lt;/a&gt;, I am now rectifying this oversight!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dh-defense-talk&quot;&gt;The DH defense talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my slides early so that this slide was on the screen before the defense began; when I give invited talks or conference presentations, I make a credits list my last slide instead, so it can stay up during Q&amp;amp;A (I also thank a few key supporters by name: my site users and testers, my dissertation advisor and committee, Michael Widner, and MITH/UMD). Note that any stats about Infinite Ulysses site use were from before the site had surprising publicity via Hacker News (the morning after my defense, so I include those stats in the first month of open beta stats).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.001.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the title slide! (That’s the full title of my dissertation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.002.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/amandavisconti/items/itemKey/4F5DJ2GB/q/taylor&quot;&gt;very favorite works on textual scholarship&lt;/a&gt;, scholarly editor Gary Taylor asks, “How can you love a work, if you don’t know it? How can you know it, if you can’t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” Scholarly editors are integral to the continuum that keeps the stories of the past available to and understood by the present—but in Taylor’s formulation, the “you” is just as important: that public of readers beyond the academy, whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant. What if we build a digital edition and invite everyone to participate in its use? My dissertation considered this question by creating and testing the Infinite Ulysses digital edition with both readers from inside and outside the academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.003.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In studying what follows from a participatory digital edition, I’ve grouped my research into three groups of inquiry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, questions about making the humanities more public and more participatory (that is, welcoming public participation, in addition to making resources theoretically publicly available). How can we design digital editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation in the scholarly love of a text?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My second set of questions focused on the design of digital editions, using Bethany Nowviskie’s idea of edition “interfacing” to do critical textual scholarship work through design, that is different from textual editing tasks. If we design editions for the public, how do we design to handle an influx of readers and annotations on texts (questions of moderation, curation, and personalization)? And what might we learn about digital editions and their texts from the accompanying influx of site use data?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My third set of questions stem from looking at Infinite Ulysses and asking, “is this an edition?” I considered whether we could separate the values of textual scholarship, from the common embodiments of these values. How might this clarification help us imagine new types of digital edition?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My presentation today will start by describing my project’s methods and format, offer some textual scholarship and digital humanities precedents for critical design and code work, and provide a brief tour of the Infinite Ulysses digital edition. I’ll also provide an overview of this project’s interventions and next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.004.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Textual scholar Morris Eaves conceives of editions not just as vessels for textual content, but also as “problem-solving mechanisms”. The problem of designing participatory digital editions was best addressed by designing, building, and testing real use of a digital edition. Analytical discussion took the form of research blogging throughout the course of the project, averaging out to about one post a month for the last three years. Analytical discussion of the project was also performed through a whitepaper authored near the end of the project; where the prospectus was a briefing for the project, with a lit review and justification of the project’s exigence, the whitepaper served as a debriefing, a place to consider what was learned and what my next research steps should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.005.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In textual scholarship, there’s a history of embodying arguments both about specific texts, and about how edition interfaces function. Editing has always intertwined theory and embodied practice. Arguments about which document (or patchwork of documents) best represents the ideal of a text, for example, were practically realized through editions of specific texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see an example of textual arguments being made through textual interfaces up on the screen. On the left is a page from the print variorum edition of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species. Between the first and sixth editions, the word count went up by 40,000 words. This is an edition that values giving the reader access, to the full picture of the text in all its variations. It is unpleasant to read, but it’s not really intended to be read, but for researchers to focus on changes to a specific section of the text (searching rather than browsing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the right, is a static screenshot of Ben Fry’s animated visualization of these changes in the text over time. If you visit his site, you can see the visualization shift, as new words are added or taken away from different sections over time, and you can also zoom in and read the text at any stage of its development. This is a textual interface that values awareness of the changing shape of the whole text over time (browsing rather than searching).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.006.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design experiments aren’t a new tactic in textual scholarship. The typographic and spatial innovations of scholarly editor Teena Rochfort Smith’s 1883 &lt;em&gt;Four-Text ‘Hamlet’ in Parallel Columns&lt;/em&gt; offer one example of experimentation, that focused on editions as a form. Smith intended this prototype to provide several transcriptions of Hamlet’s quartos, as well as her own edition of the play, side-by-side. The edition employed six varieties of typeface, four inks, three kinds of underlining, and daggers, asterisks, and other symbols to call out the presence and extent of variance. Like the Darwin print variorum, this edition values giving the reader access to a fuller picture of the text in all its variations, but this edition also values its user being able to access each work fully—something made possible by the parallel columns and notation, instead of a single column of inline variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prototype would have been nearly impossible to typeset and print in 1883. Smith worked toward a simpler final version of the edition after circulating this prototype. This suggests Smith’s initial focus was on an experiment with the form of a prototyped edition, rather than a fully realized edition with a focus on its text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.007.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent example of text-specific critical design is seen in Jeffrey Masten’s edition &lt;em&gt;A/The Old Law&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left we have a page from the EEBO scan of the early modern Middleton Rowley play, and on the right we have one of the pages as edited by Masten. He argues that for texts like this one, multiple readings of single words were the historical reality, due to puns, bad printing, and non-standardized spelling. Masten views this play as very much about multiple possible interpretations of laws legal, moral, and Biblical. He reflects this emphasis in print design by arbitrarily flipping between the use of side and footnotes, throughout the pages of his edition. Because he also includes his textual commentary in these notes, this randomizing makes it difficult for the reader to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; read the “real” text of the play, or to ignore reading about these possible variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.008.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m most interested in experiments that are somewhat text-agnostic—that have a focus on what &lt;em&gt;editions&lt;/em&gt; can do, not what &lt;em&gt;an edition&lt;/em&gt; can do for &lt;em&gt;a specific text&lt;/em&gt;. Alan Galey’s Visualizing Variation coding project is another recent example of textual experimentation, that focuses on edition form over any one text. His code set is a scholarly response, to the early modern experience of reading, when spellings varied wildly, and a reader was accustomed to holding multiple possible meanings for badly printed or ambiguously spelled words in their mind at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, his “Animated Variants” code cycles which word to display in the reading text, for contended words such as Hamlet’s sallied/solid/sullied, so that the reader isn’t biased by a word’s placement in the main text, rather than in the footnotes. By experimenting with digital means of approximating this historical experience, Galey moves theorists past discussing that this different experience of texts occurred. Instead, scholars can now respond to an actual participation in that historical experience. Galey’s coded textual experiments are themselves critical arguments about edition design. His example of a project where the principal investigator is also the lead programmer was a helpful model for my coding work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.009.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen how textual scholarship uses edition design experiments, to develop interpretive interfaces. I’d like to switch now to discussing how those edition interfaces are used, when exposed to public readers and researchers.
Lindsey Thomas notes that making something freely available online does not necessarily guarantee that thing is public, or that it will be used as a public resource. It isn’t enough to make something theoretically publicly accessible to advance a public humanities. We need to prioritize accessibility, inclusion, and education, if we want to create a real conversation among academics and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.010.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My project both designed for participation by public readers, and used participatory design by incorporating users’ feedback during the design process. In the world of textual scholarship, my edition has precedents in digital editions that allowed site visitors to transcribe, mark up, and annotate texts. The Shelley-Godwin Archive has worked toward public participation, envisioning an eventual “work-site for scholars, students, and the general public” with “contributions in the form of transcriptions, corrections, and annotations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the valuing of participation from all levels of expertise even in the beta site, where a stoplight icon visually signals the reliability of a text’s transcription, allowing non-expert markup and transcription to be made public more quickly. The New York Public Library’s &lt;em&gt;Candide 2.0&lt;/em&gt; offered public annotation alongside the novel: stating “the margin is a public space where readers can congregate, discuss and debate the book together, in intimate proximity to the text”. Participation privileges developed in stages: commissioned annotators seeded the edition with expert commentary, after which the edition was opened to public annotation for a trial period. The London Lives project similarly used a graded approach to participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.011.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve distilled my review of pertinent literature into several calls for further work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need models for conducting and analyzing user studies in the digital humanities and textual studies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need digital editions that are both public and participatory. Designing and coding participatory digital editions lets textual scholars serve more than one of the field’s intellectual values: &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; our mandate as humanists to preserve and renew the relevance of past culture, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the focus on more intimate knowledge of texts via edition-building and the interpretive work that entails.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What a digital Ulysses would do has been theorized; recent changes to the text’s digital availability mean we now need to build and test those theories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll next give you a brief tour of the edition I created in response to these calls to action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.012.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the current front page of the edition. The images give a high level tour of the edition’s features: you can highlight parts of the book and annotate those highlights; read others’ annotations; and personalize what annotations you see to your background, interests, and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.013.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an allusion to Hamlet, an annotator might explain the reference and also tag the annotation with tags like “meaning” (a tag we’ve been using to call out answers to “what does this mean?”) as well as tags like “Shakespeare”, “Hamlet”, and “intertextuality”. Other popular tags mark if an annotation translates a specific language, refers to a specific author or book or to Joyce’s biography, or relates to a topic such as Modernist style, colonialism, or religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.014.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers click on highlighted text to see any annotations tied to that highlight; these annotations appear in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.015.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each annotation on the text can receive either one upvote or one downvote from each reader. Annotation votes accrue to the user who authored those annotations, so that helpfulness and credibility of annotators can also be very roughly assessed. These votes allow readers to prioritize what annotations they are shown, when a word or phrase has multiple annotations. For example, a reader can choose to see the top-rated annotations first, or the newest annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers can also favorite annotations to save them into a personal list; I hope to eventually tie this feature into the filtering system so that users can share links to “custom” editions only showing their curated annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.016.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers can filter annotations to only display annotations dealing with areas of interest (e.g. if you’re interested in references to Shakespeare’s plays). Readers can also filter to only display annotations authored by certain users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.017.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The edition, after being open in beta or testing mode about one month, has a couple hundred user accounts (367 on Sunday) and a couple hundred annotations (416 on Sunday) (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post-defense note: when I quote the first month of open beta stats in my talks, the numbers are much, much higher: that’s because Infinite Ulysses made the Daily Top 20 on Hacker News the morning after my defense, bringing in thousands of site visitors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of those user accounts who are actually actively annotating while reading is very low so far. There were two fairly active users on the site besides myself (they added 60 and 19 annotations), with 10 users authoring 5 or more annotations, 20 users authoring 2 or more annotations, and 32 site users authoring at least 1 annotation. All but 4 of those 29 annotators are people I’d never met before. I expect site activity to pick up as more of the book is annotated, and several teachers are already planning to use the site with classes this summer and fall. It’s also worth noting that the first two chapters of the book are fairly thickly annotated by me already (around 240 annotations), so new readers might not have felt they had as much to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.018.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of code, my biggest intervention was to create a module that ties the highlighting of text from the Annotator tool, into how Drupal lets you add metadata to, filter, and sort units of content such as annotations. These social features, filtering, and sorting addressed a need already present even at the level of a few hundreds readers on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most-annotated page on the site after four weeks of the open beta had 45 annotations, with the next ten most-annotated pages each having between 10 and 25 annotations per page. Even at the level of an edition just beginning to see use, there are already too many annotations per page for most readers; we already need a way to filter out the distraction of the annotations that don’t fit our interests. In particular, the site has been read by both first-time readers of the novel and professors who have taught the text; sorting and filtering helps get the appropriate granularity of annotation to each reader, whether that’s “what does this word mean?” or “how does this dialogue fit into what we know about Joyce’s opinions on Irish politics?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.019.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite Ulysses and the dissertational project around it modeled small but actionable changes to the fields of the digital humanities and textual scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of participatory projects, Infinite Ulysses provided an example of a small but eager audience for a participatory digital humanities project; although the data gathered on site visits is early, there were over 2000 sessions of site use and over 1500 unique site visitors during this first month of open testing. The code and design work that allows textual annotations to be curated and moderated are being tested on at least two other digital editions (the Shelley-Godwin Archive and Romantic Circles); further work toward packaging and documenting the code will allow for digital humanists with less technical expertise to set up similar participatory annotation projects for their own texts, theories, and testing. Early site use data suggests that the site’s design and functionalities do represent a working route, for digital editions to support public participation, through personalization of annotations to reader and researcher needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of meaningful crowdsourcing, Infinite Ulysses provided a modest example of public digital edition visitors adding value to a text, through contextualizing and interpretive annotations over a trial month. The project also outlined a number of ways digital humanities researchers may use non-critical participation to advance scholarly knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of edition design and data, Infinite Ulysses experimented with digital edition editorial statements by providing a detailed explanation of how scholarly values were manifested through specific instances of project design and code. Preliminary data gathering and analysis provided support and pointed out flaws in my digital edition design, while also providing text-agnostic knowledge about user testing methods for participatory digital editions, that can be used by other textual scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of textual scholarship field boundaries, I’ve explored scholarly textual artifacts that draw on the values and skills of textual scholarship, without necessarily looking like a scholarly edition. By distilling textual scholarship values from their common embodiments and saving the term “scholarly edition” for a very specific type of edition, we can let the term “edition” invite broader types of textual projects that still hold true to textual scholarship values. Re-examining core assumptions about technologies like the edition can open new possibilities for humanities knowledge, and it can also help edition reviewers provide more constructive critique that better fits individual digital editions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.020.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New questions, not unexpectedly, arose from my research. I’ll want to explore the possibilities for “non-critical” but meaningful participation I’ve listed in the whitepaper, looking for projects that have tested these possibilities, and creating wireframes and prototypes exploring the untested participation methods among my suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll want to think further about design that specifically scaffolds critical digital edition participation: how can we teach critical ways of reading Ulysses without belaboring existing theories? (Teach methods, not content.) I’ll also continue analysis of site data and user feedback, using these to reassess the edition’s curation and moderation functionalities as more readers and classrooms use the edition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, I’ll add to the discussion around editorial statements for digital editions by crafting a more detailed methodological statement for Infinite Ulysses, one that focuses on the choices of design and code that perform the edition’s values, and then seeking a platform for peer review of my methodology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My distillation of textual scholarly values would only benefit from drawing in more diverse examples from the history of the field, as well as circulating my arguments for feedback and refinement. And I think the field would benefit from drawing up suggested guidelines for reviewing editions that aim at participation, something I hope to think through with members of the Shelley-Godwin team.
These steps should both improve Infinite Ulysses as a textual resource, and add to our body of knowledge about designing a more public, participatory digital humanities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/defense-slides/defense-slides.021.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of presentation slide from the dissertation defense&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(End of formal dissertation defense presentation.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-about-this-dissertation&quot;&gt;More about this dissertation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in reading more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; or the dissertation around it, the dissertation exists as &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dissertation.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;dissertation.amandavisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; was the URL I used pre-defense), which functions as an umbrella documenting all the pieces of my dissertational effort: blog posts, code repositories, links, the dissertation’s whitepaper (written just in the final month before the defense, as an analytical debriefing), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;the full set of blog posts written during my dissertation available here&lt;/a&gt;, which talk not only about the focus of my research (digital humanities design, Joyce, textual scholarship, annotation) but about the practical aspects of designing and pursuing a digital dissertation. Also, I’m always happy to answer questions &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com&quot;&gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-slides&quot;&gt;Bonus slides&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some extra slides and talking points ready for questions I anticipated, or for things I didn’t have time for in the presentation but wanted to be sure to cover. One of the anticipated questions was “Is Infinite Ulysses an edition?”, so I was very prepared to argue that it isn’t a &lt;em&gt;scholarly digital edition&lt;/em&gt; (which is a term of art meaning certain methods and rigor), but that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a digital edition. I blog that argument soon, for anyone who hasn’t heard me present on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of these slides intrigue you, feel free to contact me, or check out my dissertation whitepaper at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Humanities Dissertation Defense Advice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently realized that although &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;I thoroughly blogged my dissertation (almost 40 blog posts)&lt;/a&gt; and wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2015/05/09/dissertationdefended&quot;&gt;a post after successfully defending the dissertation in April 2015&lt;/a&gt;, I never blogged my actual defense talk. In keeping with &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;blogging the job talk&lt;/a&gt; that took me into my current job, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/grad-advice/&quot;&gt;other DH/grad student advice&lt;/a&gt;, I am now rectifying this oversight! I’ll make a few comments about the defense process in this blog post, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/20/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk&quot;&gt;I blogged the actual talk in a separate post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knowing-what-to-expect&quot;&gt;Knowing what to expect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend attending at least one dissertation defense in your department, preferably early in your degree. (I was lucky to get to attend two excellent literature defenses that incorporated digital humanities: Jason Rhody’s defense of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hdl.handle.net/1903/11161&quot;&gt;Game Fiction&lt;/a&gt;, and Lisa Rhody’s defense of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hdl.handle.net/1903/13969&quot;&gt;Ekphrastic Revisions: Verbal-Visual Networks in 20th Century Poetry by Women&lt;/a&gt;.) It was extremely useful for me to learn early on that defenses aren’t necessarily the scary things they’re made out to be in popular culture. If things go right, you should only be defending because your advisor thinks you’re ready—at that point, you have the expertise, and the defense is your opportunity to showcase the experience you’ve built up over the years of dissertational work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defense experience can be pretty similar to the orals/comps (&lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2012/11/27/info-dump-humanities-doctoral-candidacy-exams-advice/&quot;&gt;advice on those here&lt;/a&gt;), both in terms of practical preparation you can do beforehand (anticipate questions you’ll be asked, know what the room will look like where you’ll present) and in the experience (have your first five minutes just about memorized, and after that hope to relax and enjoy the chance to discuss your work—and nothing but!—with smart people for an hour.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a chance to present a version of your talk to another grad student or family—or even better, at a conference or other public venue—I’d recommend using that time to get comfortable with your talk, so that your focus just before the defense can be on the Q&amp;amp;A rather than the presentation. &lt;strong&gt;Fun fact:&lt;/strong&gt; I was going to give a Digital Dialogue at MITH the week before my defense, but the electricity across campus went out while I was on my first slide and stayed out the rest of the day, so we had to reschedule for the week &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; my defense. Didn’t get to practice the talk publicly, but I did end up feeling like nothing worse could happen during the actual defense, so it worked out all right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prepare-but-dont-worry&quot;&gt;Prepare, but don’t worry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky and privileged to have had &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/#preservation&quot;&gt;an amazing committee&lt;/a&gt;, an audience with some friendly faces (thanks, Porter, Kyle, and Jordan!), and a really positive experience—but I recognize that you should also be prepared for less ideal outcomes. We’ve all heard about questioners showing up without reading the full dissertation, and questions framed as interrogation rather than an invitation for you to share your unique expertise. At the same time, I really want to emphasize that &lt;strong&gt;the defense isn’t something to overly worry about&lt;/strong&gt;: compared to all the work you’ve done to get to this point, the defense is a time-limited situation, specific to what you’ve been thinking and working on for years, and at this moment &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are better prepared for it than anyone else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things you can do, if you are in a situation where it’s not clear the room will be entirely friendly: Practice phrases for steering confusing questions and defining the discussion in your own terms. In particular, I’d practice “double evasion” of off-topic questions, since I’ve seen this fluster conference speakers: if an audience member asks you about something that you’re not claiming expertise in via your dissertation, you can start by noting this difference but speculating briefly on possibilities, then have a statement ready if they press you again to talk about some topic outside your focus (e.g. “As I said, x and not y was the focus of my research, and you might be interested to know that [thing about x tangentially related to y and segue back into your area of research]”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My awesome advisor (Matt Kirschenbaum) also talked me through all the possible outcomes of the defense (I think these were: accepted without revisions, accepted pending revisions, or requiring a second defense? The norm tended toward being accepted with or without revisions, and if I needed revisions I shouldn’t feel bad about it). It was good to know what the best through worst possible outcomes could be (and that none were too terrible). Also, this let me emotionally prepare myself for being okay with a request for revisions (against a perfectionist streak I’m sure I share with a majority of people doing graduate studies). (I did end up passing without needing revisions, yay!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also talked about an unlikely but possible scenario for any grad student doing DH work: that someone with an ax to grind about digital scholarship shows up to the public part of the defense and makes trouble. This felt unlikely enough that I was able to not worry about it, but at the same time I had prepared for public challenges to the scholarly nature of my work. A weekly email to my advisor as a record of what I’d been doing wasn’t just motivation for me, it also kept a log we could produce if what I had been doing was questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’m leaving things out, so feel free to email (aviscont@purdue.edu) or tweet (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/Literature_Geek&quot;&gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt;) me with any questions about the defense process (note that particulars will vary by university and department, of course). I’ll share my actual defense talk in the next post early next week when I’m back from the Joyce conference.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Infinite Ulysses beta closes for 1.0 work</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Infinite Ulysses’s open beta (March 2015-May 2016) has ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-this-means-for-currentprospective-users&quot;&gt;What this means for current/prospective users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you’re just interested in future plans for the site and an overview of how the beta period went, skip to the next section.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt; participatory edition to get some serious post-beta improvements, and I’ve decided the best way to do this is taking some time off from moderating the site while I focus on its web development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site will remain up and readable (except for short hours-long downtimes when pushing major improvements), but on July 15th I’ll be closing signups for new users as well as blocking logging in/annotating by existing users for a while. Please contact &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#117;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#117;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt; with any questions this choice raises (e.g. I can try to accommodate needs such as plans to use the site in a summer or fall course or reading group, or to demo the site on a given day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com/content/terms-use&quot;&gt;the site’s public data policy&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll be emailing site users this week with an invitation to export their annotations during the next six weeks (before July 15th, 2016). After that date, &lt;strong&gt;site users will not be able to log in until after the post-beta overhaul is complete&lt;/strong&gt; (currently no set date). Before July 15, logged-in users can use new links on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com/user&quot;&gt;your user profile page&lt;/a&gt; to export DOC, XML, and CSV versions of your annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note there’s no necessity to export your annotations&lt;/strong&gt;—they’ll still be there on the 1.0 site. Since from July 15, 2016 onward until the 1.0 release is ready there will be no new site signups and no logging in or annotating for existing users, I wanted to give you access to your annotations. If you don’t export your annotations during that time, you won’t lose them—an export of all user annotations will be available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-public/tree/master/Annotations&quot;&gt;in the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; (and I see no reason for it to not stay there as long as GitHub is around, so no rush). Please contact &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#117;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#117;&amp;#108;&amp;#121;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt; with any questions or special needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-a-hiatus&quot;&gt;Why a hiatus?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to have enough stuff ready to do a 1.0 release in time for this year’s Bloomsday and my speaking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://anniversaryjoyce.com/provisional-programme/day-5-friday-17-june/&quot;&gt;XXV International James Joyce Symposium that week&lt;/a&gt; (we’re doing a full day of digital+genetic editing panels all day on Friday, including Hans Gabler and Michael Groden—pretty exciting!). Alas, I won’t have time to finish my improvements by that deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to continuing work on the site, and I do think now that I’ve settled into my new job and have some support to expand the site into a team project from a solo dissertational one, I’ll be able to release something pretty cool. But I’m not yet at a place where I can commit to a release date, and instead of continually pushing that time off, I need to make a change to reduce the moderation and community design effort the site involves, and focus on the site’s web development without feeling constantly behind where I want the site to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The community deserves care.&lt;/strong&gt; Running a digital community is so rewarding, but I need to acknowledge that I don’t have the time to currently do everything the site requires—especially the constant vigilance against abuse and spam that the community absolutely deserves. I didn’t have time to focus on accessibility testing as much as I should have; the reading interface only works for limited window sizes and breaks after a certain level of magnification, which is a poor reward for anyone answering my invitation to a public &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; conversation. And I dislike continually pushing the date for the 1.0 changes back—it’s better for everyone if I wait to make a clear promise on when and what I can do with the site (more on what’s holding back changes farther below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My research trajectory.&lt;/strong&gt; I also need to acknowledge how my research interests are developing—I’ve always been primarily interested in participatory interface design for knowledge-building, and I think of myself as more of a research programmer and textual scholar, than as a Joycean or community manager. I’m also interested in putting my research efforts more squarely toward improving student and publics access, participation, and inclusion in the humanities, and in making the humanities (researchers, topics, and audiences) more diverse. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/05/27/inclusivityeditioncanon&quot;&gt;I’ve written about this a bit in a post on why I chose Ulysses for my edition, despite this supporting the problematic canon of white male authors writing in English&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t mean to say others shouldn’t be working in Joyce studies—this is a personal decision about where I want to put my time and effort going forward). I’m interested in inviting more people into the conversations around challenging literature, and less interested in spending my future specifically wed to Joyce’s texts (although I suspect I’ll continue to do silly &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/usurper/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2012/02/20/anachronistic-linati-schema&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalliterature.net/fun/marionette.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-the-edition&quot;&gt;Testing the edition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of user testing and feedback helped shape the current site, and will be the foundation for the 1.0 version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Informal (hallway testing, tweeted questions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk-aloud observation (single and paired)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participatory design (sketching ideal layouts)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Site contact form feedback &amp;amp; emailed feedback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GitHub issue queue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open beta soft launch survey with non-academic testers (March 5th, 2015)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open beta survey responses (March 9-30, 2015)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Analytics (going forward, I want to have a clear statement to users on what kind of information I can see)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aggregated mapping (heatmaps, scrollmaps, clickmaps)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drupal statistics on frequency and authorship of annotations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;howd-the-beta-go&quot;&gt;How’d the beta go?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open beta was a fantastic experience for me. We had some decent exposure via social media, helped in no small part by making the Hacker News Top 20 the day after my dissertation defense. As of June 2, 2016, the site had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;22,251 unique visitors&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;776 members&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1,167 annotations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;283 unique annotation tags&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A huge thanks to all the site’s beta testers&lt;/strong&gt;, who generously gave me feedback on the site’s design and how it fit their individual reader and research needs. (And another shout-out to all the people whose code and support made the site possible, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com/credits&quot;&gt;listed here&lt;/a&gt;—especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mwidner&quot;&gt;Michael Widner&lt;/a&gt;, whose development of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lacunastories.com/&quot;&gt;Lacuna annotation platform&lt;/a&gt; you should definitely check out!.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there wasn’t a race for quantity over quality, special thanks are due to the site’s power annotators for their generosity to our reader community, and for helping me design the next iteration of the site to better support heavy annotation: user &lt;strong&gt;tim finnegan&lt;/strong&gt; outpacing us all with 546 excellent annotations, followed by &lt;strong&gt;bbogle&lt;/strong&gt; (159) and by three users with 20-30 annotations each—&lt;strong&gt;pbohan&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;serinamarie89&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;wvarga7a1&lt;/strong&gt;. I also authored 248 annotations myself, although many of these were drawn from my earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com&quot;&gt;UlyssesUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt; annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hey, existing site users: I have stickers created as rewards for my alpha and beta testers now—if you used the site between now and back when it went live, send me an email with your mailing address by the end of June 2016 and I’ll ship you one! Subject to not running out of them, of course…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IUSticker.png&quot; alt=&quot;Infinite Ulysses publicity sticker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The nose fell out of the logo… still looks like a face to me…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers-are-nice-but&quot;&gt;The numbers are nice, but…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been amazing to have so many strangers interact with something I built—and the number of people who visited the site (22k+) is probably a bit unusual for a literature dissertation? But the reality of those numbers suggests that while there’s interest in the idea of the project, most of those visitors didn’t stick around long to read and didn’t come back any or many times. Check out this spike of interest right after my defense, and the relative flatline after—over half (about 14,000) of the 22,251 visitors came within the first month of the open beta, with the remaining 8,000 trickling in over the following year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/statriseandfall.png&quot; alt=&quot;Line chart of site visitors since the site when live, with spike in April 2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest in the digital humanities and in designing for a more participatory literature conversation is great, but that’s really just a tiny step—the real assessment is whether I can build something that goes beyond initial curiosity, and supports people reading selections or the whole book over weeks and months. Site account creation (required to annotate and use some other features) was low compared to the total number of visits, returning visits were low, and reading without annotating was largely the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, reading &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is a significant investment of time…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AlisonBechdelUlysses.png&quot; alt=&quot;Panel from Alison Bechdel&#39;s graphic novel Fun Home, showing the protagonist reading Ulysses and swearing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Panel from Alison Bechdel’s highly recommended graphic novel&lt;/em&gt; Fun Home)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…But as much as I like to see these stats as heartening, I know I have a lot of work to do in making the look and feel of the site a delightful experience, and in making major changes to the site’s functionality supporting how people are most comfortable reading (a frequent request, touch annotation to allow comfy armchair reading, is held back by there not currently being a fully functioning plugin for this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the concerns above about keeping the annotations a safe, welcoming space for including diverse voices in the &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; conversation, I need to think through supporting a community with unusual ebbs and flows of activity. Once hooked, print readers do frequently come back to &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; for many rereads. Even with rereaders, though, most users will come to the print book or website for stretches of weeks or months, then disappear for a while. Keeping the site feeling alive meanwhile—for example, making sure readers’ new questions get answered—takes regular effort that I don’t have enough time to support myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotators, assemble!&lt;/strong&gt; I do have some ideas for addressing this ebb and flow of the reading community, and for getting the site back into a schedule of regular improvements. I’ll be thinking about how to turn the site into a community-led project: I have funding for a graduate research assistant, some offers to push improved code to the site once I’ve got the repo ready, and the hope that the project can be a space for students and staff to train in various areas of DH interest (coding, scholarly digital editing, social media work…). I’m also working on a project that will make sharing new functionalities between digital editions easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A reading-sprint model.&lt;/strong&gt; Once the 1.0 site is ready, I’m interested in trying out a reading-sprint model, where I’d advertise an approaching sprint several months in advance (optimistically, enough that any teacher could then plan to include in their course the following term), then open the site for a set period of reading by individuals, book clubs, and classes—knowing that I had team in place to support the community (curation, moderation, guidance) through that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removing the account requirement.&lt;/strong&gt; I also want to recognize that even with a delightful look and intuitive functionality, not all readers will want to annotate or sign up for the site. I need to build things so that all features except annotation and comments are open without a user account (early on, I focused over much on sign-ups as a way of tracking a threshold of site engagement—but ease of use is more important than nice stats!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splitting the text.&lt;/strong&gt; I also plan to divide the site into two interlinked texts: one text with a curated set of annotations, aimed at the bulk of people arriving at the site who just want some help reading &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;. The second text will be the place for experimenting with new features and with diverse kinds of annotation (Team Mulligan? reader injokes? annotating as the book’s characters? check, check, and check!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This split into two texts should take some of the burden off human moderators—the curated text can have annotations pulled in from the experimental text as time allows, while the experimental text can be a little more open to various kinds and granularities of annotation (though I’ll still have mechanics in place to report abuse, ask for moderation, and to require a few good-faith annotations before your annotations are visible to anyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;best-laid-plans-vs-real-life&quot;&gt;Best-laid plans vs. real life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why I keep pushing the 1.0 version off. I had a handful of site improvements I’d meant to release last Bloomsday (a couple weeks after my graduation), and lots of additional local work since then (e.g. moving annotations into a collapsible side drawer to aid tablet reading, and changing the theme to support smaller screens and greater screen magnification were big ones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dissertation scope repercussions.&lt;/strong&gt; I was lucky in having a lovely dissertation experience. But because the final beta version of the site was built largely during the final year of my dissertation (after a lot of research and trying out other tech platforms and code libraries), I didn’t have time to put in place everything I’d normally do for a professional job. Sometimes visual design suffered for the sake of functionalities I needed to move user testing forward; scope tightened and pieces dropped out (e.g. comment threading display was buggy, so I ended up just removing commenting on annotations for the beta).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incremental improvements are currently hard to push.&lt;/strong&gt; It was difficult to push incremental changes to the site; for example, simply removing the up/down voting button (an early decision) couldn’t happen until I had time to modify the site’s theme to accommodate how the annotation structure would shift into the resulting gap, or the whole display would be out of whack. The text I chose ended up having needing manual addition of Joyce’s typographic choices, and having many more OCR errors than I expected—and as with other site changes, making it possible for site users to correct errors themselves wasn’t an easy thing to add, although users were generous with locating errors. There were a lot of small things like that, and the solution really needs to be a general overhaul rather than a collage of bandaids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work is getting done, albeit not pushed to the live site.&lt;/strong&gt; Since defending the dissertation, I’ve been working locally on a bunch of other improvements, starting with a complete from-scratch rebuilding of the site’s database and theme. I’ve been able to share my code for testing on development versions of several other digital editions (Romantic Circles, the Shelley-Godwin Archive, and the Victorian COVE site I’m co-PI’ing with Dino Felluga), and I made some headway toward packaging my code for easier reuse by others at the CODEX hackathon in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with starting a new job, settling into post-student life, and moving to a new place, I haven’t been able to make the concentrated clumps of time I need to finish things up—just hours here and there, with days in between. Despite journaling constantly alongside my webdev work, it’s hard to pick work back up swiftly after putting it down for weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recognize that in trying to connect and grow the digital humanities community at Purdue, I might not have time to set this all up in the near future. The hope is to get the site to a place where others can participate in improving the site if they’re interested in doing so, but I recognize that I’ve been pushing “improvements soon!” off for a while now, and that isn’t the best situation for either me or the site’s readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fun project, and I’ve been honored by the generosity of others in helping me build something better. So: I’m going to stop saying the new site will be ready soon, and wait until I can make and keep a promise about the site’s next version. I hope that this is a reasonable way to do that (any suggestions or requests to improve how I’m implementing this decision are welcomed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;read-more-stuff-related-to-infinite-ulysses&quot;&gt;Read more stuff related to Infinite Ulysses?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Infinite Ulysses site will remain available for looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; until it’s ready for further interactive use. If you’re interested in reading more about the work behind Infinite Ulysses, you might fancy the dissertation around the edition at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com&quot;&gt;dr.AmandaVisconti.com&lt;/a&gt;, including a whitepaper discussing stuff like designing interfaces for a public humanities, how public humanities participation can be meaningful without necessarily using full “critical” academic rhetoric, an analysis of past annotation and digital &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; projects as well as my Infinite Ulysses user testing, and some thoughts on whether Infinite Ulysses is an edition (for my textual scholarship peeps.) There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;the full set of blog posts written during my dissertation available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lunar dust &amp; tapioca pudding (touring Purdue Archives&#39; aerospace collections)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lib.purdue.edu/spcol&quot;&gt;Purdue University Archives &amp;amp; Special Collections&lt;/a&gt; (ASC) have an amazing aerospace history collection due to Purdue’s many students and faculty who were pilots (Amelia Earhart was faculty), went on to be astronauts, or worked in the aerospace industry. I’m working with the ASC towards digital humanities projects that increase public and student access to our collections; in particular, we’re planning to use 3D scanning and printing to make some of the more interesting, fragile, or rare artifacts more accessible to visitors and student researchers. Today, Flight Archivist Tracy Grimm kindly gave me a tour of some of the objects we’re thinking about using in our DH work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve shared some of the more interesting things below (sorry for shaky photo quality on a couple of these!). These photos were okayed for educational sharing on social media (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lib.purdue.edu/spcol/digital-reproduction-requests&quot;&gt;copyright info here&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested in using these somehow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1087.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelia Earhart’s goggles&lt;/strong&gt;. These are too fragile for regular handling; we want to explore using various types of 3D printing filament (pliable, glass-like) to replicate these as wearable facsimiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1088.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An ice pick Amelia Earhart used&lt;/strong&gt; to puncture open cans of tomato juice. She used these as a compact way of getting calories while flying. (I think Tracy said this was a specific brand—Beecham’s?—and that Earhart was used in their advertisements.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1128.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1129.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking out the safe inside the archives vault where artifacts are kept extra-secure, including Amelia Earhart’s scrapbooks and helmet, the smelling salts she used to keep awake during her flights, and flight suits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1090.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;glove&lt;/strong&gt; astronaut Eugene Cernan wore on the moon. Sealed in a bag so as not to lose any of the &lt;strong&gt;lunar dust&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1091.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AerospaceTour/IMG_1127.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A “frangible nut” from a space shuttle flown on by astronaut Janice Voss&lt;/strong&gt;. The nut was packed with explosive charges and separated from a rocket on takeoff (presented on a commemorative plaque). It’s quite heavy, and the edges are sharp where explosives sheared off the metal. The nuts were originally around 50 lbs, so this fragment is about 25 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronaut food&lt;/strong&gt; from the Mark N. Brown Papers collection, assumedly used during training on Earth. Each contains info on how to prepare the food. Potatoes au gratin, noodles and chicken, tapioca pudding, butter cookies! Each unit includes a small velcro dot (to anchor the food to something when there’s no gravity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollo XVII LRV Map Book&lt;/strong&gt;, a commemorative binding of maps actually used on the moon by astronaut Eugene Cernan while traveling on the lunar rover. A broken fender on the lunar rover had to be repaired (while on the moon!) with 4 of the map pages (the Smithsonian has the repaired fender in its collection). The individual pages aren’t too interesting to look at, but we’re thinking about creating a digital quilt of the images and then augmenting this with historical and topographical information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I published &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;a peer-reviewed piece on building your own scholarly blog or website at &lt;em&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week and am cross-posting the lesson here (but check it out at the Programming Historian, which has a bunch of fantastic DH lessons on other topics too!). The lesson was generously edited by Fred Gibbs and reviewed by Fred Gibbs, Paige Morgan, and Jaime Howe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;building-a-static-website-with-jekyll-and-github-pages&quot;&gt;Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This lesson is for you if&lt;/strong&gt; you’d like an entirely free, easy-to-maintain, preservation-friendly, secure website over which you have full control, such as a scholarly blog, project website, or online portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of this lesson&lt;/strong&gt;, you’ll have a basic live website where you can publish content that other people can visit—it will look like &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;!—and you’ll also have some resources to explore if you want to further customize the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; A computer (Mac/Windows/Linux are all okay, but this lesson doesn’t cover some aspects of Linux use), the ability to download and install software on the computer, an internet connection that can support downloading software. Users have reported needing between 1-3 hours to complete the entire lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty level:&lt;/strong&gt; Intermediate (this lesson includes use of the command line and git, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; walks you through anything needed to complete this lesson). Forthcoming lessons in the basics of git/GitHub and GitHub Pages will be linked here when available, and provide a good background for anyone wishing for deeper understanding of the technology used in this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-static-sites-jekyll-etc--why-might-i-care-a-idsection0a&quot;&gt;What are static sites, Jekyll, etc. &amp;amp; why might I care? &lt;a id=&quot;section0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This tutorial is built on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/&quot;&gt;official Jekyll Documentation&lt;/a&gt; written by the Jekyll community. See the &lt;a href=&quot;#section9-3&quot;&gt;“Read more”&lt;/a&gt; section below if you’d like to know even more about these terms!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dynamic-websites-static-websites--jekyll-a-idsection0-1a&quot;&gt;Dynamic websites, static websites, &amp;amp; Jekyll &lt;a id=&quot;section0-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamic websites&lt;/em&gt;, such as those created and managed by a content management system such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.com/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://omeka.org/&quot;&gt;Omeka&lt;/a&gt;, pull information from a database to fill in the content on a webpage. When you search for a book on Amazon.com, for example, the search results page you are shown didn’t already exist as a full HTML page; instead, Amazon.com has a template for search results page that includes things all results pages share (like the main menu and Amazon logo), but it queries the database to insert the results of that search you initiated into that template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Static websites&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, do not use a database to store information; instead, all information to be displayed on each webpage is already contained in an HTML file for that webpage. The HTML pages that make up a static site can be completely written by hand, or you can offload some of this work using something like Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jekyll&lt;/em&gt; is software that helps you “generate” or create a &lt;em&gt;static website&lt;/em&gt; (you may see Jekyll described as a “static site generator”). Jekyll takes page templates—those things like main menus and footers that you’d like shared across all the web pages on your site, where manually writing the HTML to include them on every webpage would be time-consuming. These templates are combined with other files with specific information (e.g. a file for each blog post on the site) to generate full HTML pages for website visitors to see. Jekyll doesn’t need to do anything like querying a database and creating a new HTML page (or filling in a partial one) when you visit a webpage; it’s already got the HTML pages fully formed, and it just updates them when/if they ever change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that when someone refers to a “Jekyll website”, they really mean a static (plain HTML) website that has been created using Jekyll. Jekyll is software that creates websites. Jekyll isn’t actually “running” the live website; rather, Jekyll is a “static site generator”: it helps you create the static site files, which you then host just as you would any other HTML website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because static sites are really just text files (no database to complicate matters), you can easily &lt;em&gt;version&lt;/em&gt; a static site—that is, use a tool to keep track of the different versions of the site over time by tracking how the text files that compose the site have been altered. Versioning is especially helpful when you need to merge two files (e.g. two students are writing a blog post together, and you want to combine their two versions), or when you want compare files to look for differences among them (e.g. “How did the original About page describe this project?”). Versioning is great when working with a team (e.g. helps you combine and track different people’s work), but it’s also useful when writing or running a website on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github--github-pages-a-idsection0-2a&quot;&gt;GitHub &amp;amp; GitHub Pages &lt;a id=&quot;section0-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a free place to store the files that run a website and host that website for people to visit (it only works for particular types of website, like basic HTML sites or Jekyll sites, and does not host databases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a visual way to use &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/documentation&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a system for &lt;em&gt;versioning&lt;/em&gt;: keeping track of changes to computer files (including code and text documents) over time (as explained &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-1&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re curious, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/&quot;&gt;a friendly lesson for exploring GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-reasons-for-using-a-static-website-a-idsection0-3a&quot;&gt;What are the reasons for using a static website? &lt;a id=&quot;section0-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.com/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://omeka.org/&quot;&gt;Omeka&lt;/a&gt; are good for the needs of complex, interactive websites like Amazon or an interactive digital edition of a novel—but for many blogs, project websites, and online portfolios, a static website (such as a website created using Jekyll) can do everything you need while providing some nice perks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;: Updates and maintenance are needed far less often (less than once a year vs. weekly-monthly).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preservation:&lt;/strong&gt; No database means that the text files making up your site are all you need to save to preserve and replicate your site. It’s easy to back your site up or submit it to an institutional repository.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Because there isn’t a database and there aren’t a bunch of code files providing features you might not even need, there are far fewer actual pieces of your website—it’s easier to go through them all and actually know what each does, should you be so inclined. Therefore, it’s much easier to become both a basic and an advanced Jekyll user.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More customization possible&lt;/strong&gt;: Since learning to master your website is easier, things you’ll definitely want to do, like changing the look (the “theme”) of a Jekyll-created site, are much easier than altering the look of a WordPress or Drupal site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free hosting:&lt;/strong&gt; While many website tools like Drupal, WordPress, and Omeka are free, hosting them (paying for someone to serve your website’s files to site visitors) can cost money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versioning:&lt;/strong&gt; Hosting on GitHub Pages means your site is linked into GitHub’s visual interface for git versioning, so you can track changes to your site and always roll back to an earlier state of any blog post, page, or the site itself if needed. This includes uploaded files you might want to store on the site, like old syllabi and publications. (Versioning is &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-1&quot;&gt;explained in more detail above&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no database to protect from hackers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Minimal website files and no database to query mean a faster page-loading time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a static website using Jekyll offers more perks in addition to all the benefits of a hand-coded HTML static website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s easier to get started customizing your site and writing its content, since you won’t need to learn or use HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built for blogging:&lt;/strong&gt; Jekyll was built to support blog posts, so it’s easy to blog (add new, date-sorted content) and do related tasks like display an archive of all blog posts by month, or include a link to the three most recent blog posts at the bottom of each post.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Templating automates repeated tasks:&lt;/strong&gt; Jekyll makes it easy to automate repeated website tasks via its “templating” system: you can create content that should, for example, appear on the header and footer of every page (e.g. logo image, main menu), or following the title of every blog post (e.g. author name and publication date). This templated information will automatically be repeated on every appropriate webpage, instead of forcing you to manually rewrite that information on every webpage where you want it to appear. Not only does this save a lot of copying and pasting—if you ever want to change something that appears on every page of your website (e.g. a new site logo or a new item in the main menu), changing it once in a template will change in on every place it appears on your website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparing-for-installation-a-idsection1a&quot;&gt;Preparing for installation &lt;a id=&quot;section1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re ready to get to work! In the rest of this lesson, we’re going to get a few programs installed on your computer, use the command line to install a few things that can only be installed that way, look at and customize a private version of your website, and finally make your website publicly accessible on the Web. If you run into problems at any point in this lesson, see the &lt;a href=&quot;#section9&quot;&gt;help section&lt;/a&gt; for how to ask questions or report issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we’ll make sure you have a couple things ready on your computer for when we need them later in the lesson by covering what operating system you can use (i.e. Mac/Windows/Linux), creating a GitHub account and installing the GitHub app, why you should use a “text editor” program to work on your website, and how to use the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything this lesson has you install is a standard and trusted web development tool, so it isn’t important to know exactly what each of these things do before installing it. I’ll try to balance more information about the things it’s most useful for you to fully understand, with providing a brief explanation for each piece and also link to further information in case you’d like to know more about what you’re putting on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operating-systems-a-idsection1-0a&quot;&gt;Operating systems &lt;a id=&quot;section1-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial should be usable by both Mac and Windows users. Jekyll can also work for Linux; this tutorial uses the GitHub Desktop software (Mac and Windows only) for simplicity, but Linux users will need to use git over the command line instead (not covered here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll isn’t officially supported for Windows, which means none of the official Jekyll documentation (the pages that walk you through setting up Jekyll and what its different pieces do, which you could consult instead of or in addition to this lesson) addresses Windows use. I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey/&quot;&gt;David Burela’s Windows instructions&lt;/a&gt; to note the places in the &lt;a href=&quot;#section2&quot;&gt;“Installing Dependencies” section&lt;/a&gt; when Windows users should do something different; the rest of the lesson should work the same for both Mac and Windows users, though note that screenshots throughout the lesson are all from a Mac (so thing may look slightly different for a Windows user).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github-user-account-a-idsection1-1a&quot;&gt;GitHub user account &lt;a id=&quot;section1-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A GitHub user account will let you host your website (make it available for others to visit) for free on GitHub (we’ll cover how in a later step). As a bonus, it will also let you keep track of versions of the website and its writing as it grows or changes over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub.com&lt;/a&gt; and click on the “Sign up” button on the upper right. Write your desired username. This will be visible to others, identify you on GitHub, and also be part of your site’s URL; for example, the author’s GitHub username is amandavisconti and her demo Jekyll site’s URL is http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/. (&lt;em&gt;Note you can also purchase your own domain name and use it for this site, but that won’t be covered in this tutorial&lt;/em&gt;). Also write your desired email address and password, then click “Create an account”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the next page, click the “Choose” button next to the “Free” plan option, ignore the “Help me set up an organization next” checkbox, and click “Finish sign up”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional&lt;/em&gt;: Visit https://github.com/settings/profile to add a full name (can be your real name, GitHub user name, or something else) and other public profile information, if desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github-desktop-app-a-idsection1-2a&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop app &lt;a id=&quot;section1-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GitHub Desktop app will make updating your live website (one we set it up) easy—instead of using the command line every time you want to update your site, you’ll be able to use an easier visual tool to update your site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Desktop site&lt;/a&gt; and click on the “Download GitHub Desktop” button to download the GitHub Desktop software to your computer (Mac and Windows only; Linux users will need to use git just via the command line, which is not covered in this version of the tutorial).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the file has completely downloaded, double-click on it and use the following directions to install GitHub Desktop…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the username and password for the GitHub.com account you created using the steps above. (Ignore the “Add an Enterprise Account” button.) Click “Continue”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the name and email address you want the work on your site to be associated with (probably just your public name and work email address, but it’s up to you!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the same page, click the “Install Command Line Tools” button and enter your computer’s username and password if prompted (then click the “Install Helper” button on the prompt). After you get a popup message that all command line tools have successfully installed, click continue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The last page will ask “Which repositories would you like to use?”. Ignore this and click the “Done” button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional:&lt;/em&gt; Follow the walkthrough of the GitHub Desktop app that will appear (this isn’t necessary; we will cover anything you need to do with GitHub in this lesson).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;text-editor-a-idsection1-3a&quot;&gt;Text editor &lt;a id=&quot;section1-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to download and install a “text editor” program on your computer for making small customizations to your Jekyll site’s code. Good free options include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html&quot;&gt;TextWrangler&lt;/a&gt; (Mac) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&quot;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt; (Windows). Software aimed at word processing, like Microsoft Word or Word Pad, isn’t a good choice because it’s easy to forget how to format and save the file, accidentally adding in extra and/or invisible formatting and characters that will break your site. You’ll want something that specifically can save what you write as plaintext (e.g. HTML, Markdown).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional:&lt;/em&gt; See &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-2&quot;&gt;the “Authoring in Markdown” section below&lt;/a&gt; for notes on a Markdown-specific editing program, which you may also wish to install when you get to the point of authoring webpages and/or blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;command-line-a-idsection1-4a&quot;&gt;Command line &lt;a id=&quot;section1-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command line is a way to interact with your computer using text: it lets you type in commands for actions from simpler things such as “show me a list of the files in this directory” or “change who is allowed to access this file”, to more complex behavior. Sometimes there are nice visual ways to do things on your computer (e.g. the GitHub Desktop app &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-2&quot;&gt;we installed above&lt;/a&gt;), and sometimes you’ll need to use the command line to type out commands to get your computer to do things. The Programming Historian has &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash&quot;&gt;an in-depth lesson exploring the command line written&lt;/a&gt; by Ian Milligan and James Baker if you want more information than provided here, but this lesson will cover everything you need to know to complete the lesson (and we’ll only use the command line when it’s necessary or much easier than a visual interface).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the command line uses text commands, a “graphical user interface” (aka GUI) is what you probably normally use to work with your computer: anything where commands are given through a visual interface containing icons, images, mouse-clicking, etc. is a GUI. Often it’s simpler and faster to type in (or cut and paste from a tutorial) a series of commands via the command line, than to do something using a GUI; sometimes there are things you’ll want to do for which no one has yet created a GUI, and you’ll need to do them via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default command line program is called “Terminal” on Macs (located in &lt;em&gt;Applications &amp;gt; Utilities&lt;/em&gt;), and “Command Prompt”, “Windows Power Shell”, or “Git Bash” on Windows (these are three different options that each differ in the type of commands they accept; we’ll go in detail on which you should use later in the lesson).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is what a command line window looks like on the author’s Mac (using Terminal). You’ll see something like the &lt;em&gt;Macbook-Air:~ DrJekyll$&lt;/em&gt; below in your command line window; that text is called the “prompt” (it’s prompting you to input commands). In the screenshot, &lt;em&gt;Macbook-Air&lt;/em&gt; is the name of my computer, and &lt;em&gt;DrJekyll&lt;/em&gt; is the user account currently logged in (the prompt will use different names for your computer and username).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked to open a command line window and enter commands in this lesson, keep the following in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commands that you should type (or copy/paste) into the command line are formatted like this:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example of code formatting&lt;/code&gt;. Each formatted chunk of code should be copied and pasted into the command line, followed by pressing enter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let installation processes run &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; before entering new commands.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes typing a command and pressing enter produces an instantaneous result; sometimes lots of text will start to fill up the command line window, or the command line window will seem to not be doing anything (but something is actually happening behind the scenes, like downloading a file). &lt;strong&gt;When you’ve typed a command and hit enter, you’ll need to wait for that command to completely finish before typing &lt;em&gt;anything else&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or you might stop a process in the middle, causing problems. 
{0}. You’ll know your command has completed when the command line spits out the prompt again (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Macbook-Air:~ DrJekyll$&lt;/em&gt; on the author’s computer). See the screenshot below for an example of inputting a command, followed by some text showing you what was happening while that command was processed (and sometimes asking you to do something, like enter your password), and finally the reappearance of the command prompt to let you know it’s okay to type something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you need to do something else at the command line and don’t want to wait, just open a separate command line window (on a Mac, hit command-N or go to &lt;em&gt;Shell &amp;gt; New Window &amp;gt; New Window with Settings-Basic&lt;/em&gt;) and do things there while waiting for the process in the other command line window to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typing or pasting in the same commands a lot, or want to remember something you typed earlier? You can type the &lt;strong&gt;↑&lt;/strong&gt; (up arrow) at the command line to scroll through recently typed commands; just press enter after the one you want to use appears.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installing-dependencies-a-idsection2a&quot;&gt;Installing dependencies &lt;a id=&quot;section2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ll install some software dependencies (i.e. code Jekyll depends on to be able to work), using the command line because there isn’t a visual interface for doing this. This section is divided into instructions for if you’re &lt;a href=&quot;#sectionMac&quot;&gt;On a Mac&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;#sectionWindows&quot;&gt;On Windows&lt;/a&gt;, so skip down to &lt;a href=&quot;#sectionWindows&quot;&gt;On Windows&lt;/a&gt; now if you’re using Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-a-mac-a-idsectionmaca&quot;&gt;On a Mac &lt;a id=&quot;sectionMac&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re using a Mac computer, follow the instructions below until you hit a line that says the Windows-specific instructions are beginning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open a command line window (Applications &amp;gt; Utilities &amp;gt; Terminal) and enter the code shown in the steps below (&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code is formatted like this&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), keeping &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-4&quot;&gt;the command line tips from above&lt;/a&gt; in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;command-line-tools-suite-a-idsection2-1a&quot;&gt;Command line tools suite &lt;a id=&quot;section2-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to first install the Mac “command line tools” suite to be able to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; (which we’ll install next). Homebrew lets you download and install open-source software on Macs from the command line (it’s a “package manager”), which will make installing Ruby (the language Jekyll is built on) easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Terminal, paste the following code then press enter:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xcode-select --install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see something like the following text, followed by a popup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the popup, click the “Install” button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see a message that “The software was installed” when the installation is complete:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-2.5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;homebrew-a-idsection2-2a&quot;&gt;Homebrew &lt;a id=&quot;section2-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the command line tools suite has completed installation, return to your command line window and enter the following to install &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to press enter when prompted and enter your computer password when asked. For reference, below is a screenshot of the command entered into the author’s command line, followed by all the text that appeared (including the prompt to press enter, and to enter my password).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ruby--ruby-gems-a-idsection2-3a&quot;&gt;Ruby &amp;amp; Ruby Gems &lt;a id=&quot;section2-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is built from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;Ruby coding language&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby Gems&lt;/a&gt; makes setting up Ruby software like Jekyll easy (it’s a package manager, just like Homebrew—instead of making installation easy on Macs, it adds some stuff to make Ruby installations simpler).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install ruby&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to wait until the command prompt appears again to type the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install rubygems-update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nodejs-a-idsection2-4a&quot;&gt;NodeJS &lt;a id=&quot;section2-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot;&gt;NodeJS&lt;/a&gt; (or Node.js) is a development platform (in particular, a “runtime environment”) that does things like making Javascript run faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install node&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll-a-idsection2-5a&quot;&gt;Jekyll &lt;a id=&quot;section2-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is the code that creates your website (i.e. “site generation”), making it easier to do certain common tasks such as using the same template (same logo, menu, author information…) on all your blog post pages. There’s more info on &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-1&quot;&gt;what Jekyll and static sites are&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-3&quot;&gt;why you’d want to use Jekyll to make a static website&lt;/a&gt;, above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install jekyll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip the following steps (which are for Windows users only) and jump down to &lt;a href=&quot;#section3&quot;&gt;Setting up Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-windows-a-idsectionwindowsa&quot;&gt;On Windows &lt;a id=&quot;sectionWindows&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instructions for Windows users differ from those for Mac users just in this one “Installing dependencies” section. Only do the following if you’re using Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need a command line tool that recognizes the same commands Macs and Linux computers (i.e. Unix operating systems) do. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/downloads&quot;&gt;https://git-scm.com/downloads&lt;/a&gt; and click on the “Windows” link under “Downloads”. Once the download has finished, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the steps to install Git Bash (leave all options the way they already are).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open “Command Prompt” (open your Start Menu and search for “Command Prompt” and an app you can open should come up).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chocolatey is a “package manager”: code that lets you download and install open-source software on Windows easily from the command line. We’ll now install Chocolately (&lt;em&gt;make sure to highlight and copy the whole club of text below together, not as separate lines&lt;/em&gt;). Enter the code shown in the steps below (&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code is formatted like this&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), keeping &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-4&quot;&gt;the command line tips from above&lt;/a&gt; in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command &quot;(iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(&#39;https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1&#39;))) &amp;gt;$null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close the “Command Prompt” app and open “Git Bash” (which you recently installed) instead. &lt;strong&gt;You’ll now use Git Bash any time the command line is called for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jekyll is built from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;Ruby coding language&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby Gems&lt;/a&gt; makes setting up Ruby software like Jekyll easy (it’s a package manager, just like Homebrew—instead of making installation easy on Macs, it adds some stuff to make Ruby installations simpler). We’ll now install Ruby (this will take a few minutes):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;choco install ruby -y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close the command line program and restart (Ruby won’t work until you’ve done this once)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is the code that creates your website (i.e. “site generation”), making it easier to do certain common tasks such as using the same template (same logo, menu, author information…) on all your blog post pages. There’s more info on &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-1&quot;&gt;what Jekyll and static sites are&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href=&quot;#section0-3&quot;&gt;why you’d want to use Jekyll to make a static website&lt;/a&gt;, above. We’ll now install Jekyll (if Windows Security gives you a warning popup, ignore it):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install jekyll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From now on, all instructions are for both Mac and PC users!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-jekyll-a-idsection3a&quot;&gt;Setting up Jekyll &lt;a id=&quot;section3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve now installed everything needed to make your website. In this section, we’ll use Jekyll to generate a new folder full of the files that constitute your website. We’ll also locate this folder in a place accessible to the GitHub Desktop app so they’re in the right place when we want to publish them as a public website later in the lesson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll need to know the file path to the GitHub folder created by installing the GitHub Desktop app (this is some text that says where a specific folder or file is within the directory tree on your computer, e.g. /Desktop/MyRecipes/Spaghetti.doc). If you don’t know the GitHub folder file path, click on the magnifying glass icon in the top right of your computer screen (on a Mac) or use the search field on the Start Menu (Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On Macs, a search box will appear in the middle of the screen; type in “GitHub”, then double-click on the “GitHub” option that appears under “Folders” to reveal the GitHub folder in Finder (this may look slightly different on Windows, but should function the same).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note that on some computers, this folder is instead labeled “GitHub for Macs” and may not show up on a search; if the previous steps didn’t locate a GitHub folder for you, navigate to Library &amp;gt; Application Support in Finder and check if a “GitHub for Mac” folder is located there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Right-click on the “GitHub” folder and choose “Copy ‘GitHub’”. The GitHub folder file path is now copied to your clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, write &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;, followed by a space, followed by the file path to your GitHub folder (either type it in if known, or press Command-v to paste in the file path you copied in the previous step). On the author’s computer (logged in as the user &lt;em&gt;DrJekyll&lt;/em&gt;) this command looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;cd&lt;/em&gt; command (&lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt;hange &lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;irectory) tells your computer to look at the place in the computer’s folder system you specify by the path typed after it—in this case, the path to the GitHub folder created by installing the GitHub Desktop app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your site’s public URL will take the form http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/, with &lt;em&gt;amandavisconti&lt;/em&gt; being the author’s GitHub username and &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; the name of the site I entered at this step (&lt;em&gt;an option to purchase and use your own &lt;a href=&quot;#section7-2&quot;&gt;custom URL&lt;/a&gt; is possible, but not covered in this lesson&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;Lowercase and uppercase website names do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; point to the same website automatically&lt;/strong&gt;, so unlike my &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; example you might wish to pick an all-lowercase name to make sure people who hear about the site tend to type its URL correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, type in the following (but replace &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; with whatever you want your site to be called):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new JekyllDemo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This command told &lt;em&gt;jekyll&lt;/em&gt; to create a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; site by installing all the necessary files in a folder named &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;The folder you create at this step (e.g. &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;) will be referred to as the “website folder” for the rest of this tutorial.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, type in the following to navigate into your site folder (through the rest of this lesson, always replace &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; with whatever name you chose for your site in the previous step):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd JekyllDemo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you look in the &lt;em&gt;GitHub &amp;gt; JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; folder in Finder, you’ll see that a bunch of new files—the files that will run your website!—have been installed (we’ll describe what each does &lt;a href=&quot;#section4-2&quot;&gt;further on in the lesson&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bundler is a Ruby “Gem” (a package of Ruby code that adds some specific feature to your site) that will make testing your site easier; it needs to be installed directly into the website folder we just created (e.g. &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;), which is why we didn’t install it earlier in this lesson. At the command line, enter:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install bundler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to wait until the command prompt appears again to type the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new file named “Gemfile” will appear in your website folder. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://tosbourn.com/what-is-the-gemfile/&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/a&gt; helps your site keep track of all the dependencies it requires to run without breaking (dependencies are pieces of code that software &lt;em&gt;depends&lt;/em&gt; on or requires, if you don’t want errors to occur).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate to your website folder in Finder (Macs) or your directory folder (Windows), and open the “Gemfile” file; you’ll want to open this and any future website files using your &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-3&quot;&gt;text editor&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. TextWrangler). To force a file to open with your text editor, right-click on the file, then chose “Open with” and select the text editor program (you may need to choose “Other…” to find the text editor if it isn’t in the list that appears).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-12.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can also drag and drop a text file onto the icon for your text editor program (e.g. on the Dock/menubar).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the two following lines of text, on separate lines and with the same lower-case formatting (as shown in the screenshot below), then &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
gem &#39;jekyll&#39;
gem &#39;github-pages&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-13.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, type&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This will install the &lt;em&gt;jekyll&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;github-pages&lt;/em&gt; gems you just listed in the Gemfile. (Don’t forget to let the entire process finish and the prompt reappear before typing any more commands! This process will take a few minutes, as a number of dependencies are being installed.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You won’t need to mess with the Gemfile again, since we’ll be hosting your website on GitHub Pages and GitHub Pages does not allow additional site dependencies or plugins (code that adds specific features, like social media buttons after every post; &lt;a href=&quot;#section7-2&quot;&gt;more on plugins below&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-a-website-locally-a-idsection3aa&quot;&gt;Running a website locally &lt;a id=&quot;section3a&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section will describe how to run your website&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;locally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;—meaning you’ll be able to see what your website will look like in a web browser just on your computer (aka locally), but not anywhere else. Working on a “local” version of a website means that it’s private to your computer; no one else can see your website yet (your website isn’t “live” or “public”: no one can type in the URL and see it in their browser).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This means you can experiment all you want, and only publish your site for the world to see when it’s ready. Or, once you’ve made your site live, you can continue to experiment locally with new writing, design, etc. and only add these to the public site once you’re happy with how they look on the local site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the command line, type&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the command you’ll run whenever you want to view your website locally:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/em&gt; tells your computer to run Jekyll locally.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;–watch&lt;/em&gt; together with &lt;em&gt;bundle exec&lt;/em&gt; tells Jekyll to watch for changes to the website’s files, such as you writing and saving a new blog post or webpage, and to include these changes on refreshing your web browser. &lt;strong&gt;An exception to this&lt;/strong&gt; is the _config.yml file, which I’ll discuss in more detail in the next section (any changes made there &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; show up until you stop and restart Jekyll).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After typing in the command in the previous step, you’ll notice that the process never finishes. Remember how on the command line, if you type in anything while the previous command is still processing, you can cause problems? Jekyll is now being run from this command line window, so you’ll need to open a new command line window if you want to type other commands while your local site is still accessible to you (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section1-4&quot;&gt;the section on command line usage above&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-10.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Reports and error messages caused by changes you make to the files in the website folder will appear in this command line window, and are a good first place to check if something isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To stop running the site locally, press &lt;strong&gt;control-c&lt;/strong&gt; (this frees up the command line window for use again). Just enter &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt; again to start running the site locally again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;View your locally-running site by visiting &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll see a basic Jekyll website with boilerplate text:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mini-cheatsheet-a-idsection3a-1a&quot;&gt;Mini cheatsheet &lt;a id=&quot;section3a-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt; at the command line to start running your website locally. You’d visit &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/strong&gt; in a browser to see your local site now, but in the next section we’ll be changing things such that you’ll need to visit &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/strong&gt; to see the site from then on (filling in your website folder name for &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;, and making sure to include the last slash).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;strong&gt;control-c&lt;/strong&gt; at the command line to stop running the website locally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the site is running, after making changes to website files: save the files and refresh the webpage to see the changes—&lt;strong&gt;except for the _config.yml file&lt;/strong&gt;, for which you must stop running the website and restart running the website to see changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typing or pasting in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt; a lot? Instead, you can type the ↑ (up arrow) at the command line to scroll through recently typed commands; just press enter after the command you want to use appears.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tweaking-the-settings-a-idsection4a&quot;&gt;Tweaking the settings &lt;a id=&quot;section4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You now have a basic, private website accessible only on your computer. In this section, we’ll begin to customize your site by changing the website title and author information, and giving a brief overview of what the different website files do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-site-settings-via-configyml-a-idsection4-1a&quot;&gt;Basic site settings via _config.yml &lt;a id=&quot;section4-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate to your website folder in Finder (Macs) or the directory folder (Windows. The author’s website at &lt;em&gt;/Users/DrJekyll/GitHub/JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;DrJekyll&lt;/em&gt; is my logged in username, and &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; is the name of my website folder). &lt;a href=&quot;#section3&quot;&gt;Return to the “Setting up Jekyll” section&lt;/a&gt; if you need help locating your website folder.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-18.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll start by customizing the main settings file, &lt;strong&gt;_config.yml&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll want to open this and any future website files using your text editor (e.g. TextWrangler on Macs or Notepad++ on Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-15.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; file is a file “meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values for which your are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that” (as it says inside the file!). &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; is the place where you can set the title of your site, share information like your email address that you want associated with the site, or add other “basic settings”-type information you want available across your website.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;.yml&lt;/em&gt; file type refers to how the file is written using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML&quot;&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt; (the acronym standing for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”); YAML is a way of writing data that is both easy for humans to write and read, and easy for machines to interpret. You won’t need to learn much about YAML, besides keeping the &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; formatted the way it originally is even as you customize the text it contains (e.g. the title information is on a separate line from your email).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can change the text in this file, save the file, and then visit your local website in a browser to see the changes. &lt;strong&gt;Note that changes to _config.yml&lt;/strong&gt;, unlike the rest of your website files, will not show up if made while the website is already running; you need to make them while the website isn’t running, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; after making changes to _config.yml stop then start running the website, to see changes made to this particular file. (&lt;em&gt;Changes to the _config.yml file were left out of the ability to refresh because this file can be used to declare things like the structure of site links, and altering these while the site is running could badly break things.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Making small changes to website files (one at a time to start with), saving, and then refreshing to see the effect on your site means if you mess anything up, it will be clear what caused the issue and how to undo it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note that any line that starts with a &lt;strong&gt;#&lt;/strong&gt; sign is a &lt;em&gt;comment&lt;/em&gt;: comments aren’t read as code, and instead serve as a way to leave notes about how to do something or why you made a change to the code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Comments can always be deleted without effect to your website (e.g. you can delete the commented lines 1-6 in &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; if you don’t want to always see this info about Jekyll use).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; file according to these instructions:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;title&lt;/strong&gt;: The title of your website, as you want it to appear in the header of the webpage.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt;: Your email address.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;description&lt;/strong&gt;: A description of your website that will be used in search engine results and the site’s RSS feed.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;baseurl&lt;/strong&gt;: Fill in the quotation marks with a forward slash followed by the name of your website folder (e.g. “/JekyllDemo”) to help locate the site at the correct URL.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;url&lt;/strong&gt;: Replace “http://yourdomain.com” with “localhost:4000” to help locate your local version of the site at the correct URL.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;twitter_username&lt;/strong&gt;: Your Twitter username (do not include @ symbol).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;github_username&lt;/strong&gt;: Your GitHub username.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The changes you made to the &lt;em&gt;baseurl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;url&lt;/em&gt; lines will let your site run from the same files both locally on your computer and live on the Web, but &lt;strong&gt;doing this changed the URL where you’ll see your local site from now on&lt;/strong&gt; (while &lt;a href=&quot;#section3-1&quot;&gt;Jekyll is running&lt;/a&gt;) from localhost:4000 to &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/strong&gt; (substitute your website folder name for &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; and remembering the last slash mark).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the screenshot below, I have deleted the initial commented lines 1-6 as well as the commented text stating what “description” does (not necessary, just to show you can delete comments that you don’t care about seeing!) as customized the rest of the file as instructed above:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Save the file, and start (or stop and restart if it’s currently running) the website, then visit &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/strong&gt; (substituting your website folder name for &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; and remembering the last slash mark) to see your customized local site:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-17.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-and-what-is-everything-a-idsection4-2a&quot;&gt;Where (and what) is everything? &lt;a id=&quot;section4-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how your site works and what files you’d experiment with to do more advanced things, here are some notes on what each folder or file in your current website folder does. Remember to always open and edit any files with a text editor (e.g. TextWrangler) and not a word processor (e.g. not Microsoft Word or anything that lets you add formatting like italic and bold); this prevents invisible formatting characters from being saved in the file and messing up the website. If you just want to start adding content to your site and make it public, you can &lt;a href=&quot;#section5&quot;&gt;skip to the next section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-18.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_config.yml&lt;/strong&gt; is discussed &lt;a href=&quot;#section4-1&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;; it provides basic settings information about your site, such as the site’s title and additional possibilities we won’t cover here, like how to structure links to posts (e.g. should they follow the pattern MySite.com/year/month/day/post-title?).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_includes&lt;/strong&gt; folder has files that get included on all or certain pages (e.g. code to make the header contain your site title and main menu on every page of the site)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_layouts&lt;/strong&gt; folder contains code that controls how the pages on your site look (default.html), as well as customizations of that code to further style blog posts (post.html) and pages (page.html)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_posts&lt;/strong&gt; folder holds the individual files that each represent a blog post on your website. Adding a new post to this folder will make a new blog post appear on your website, in reverse chronological order (newest post to oldest). We’ll cover adding blog posts in the &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-2&quot;&gt;next section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_sass&lt;/strong&gt; folder holds SCSS files that control the visual design of the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_site&lt;/strong&gt; folder is where the HTML pages that appear on the web are generated and stored (e.g. you’ll write and save posts as Markdown files, but Jekyll will convert these to HTML for display in a web browser)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;about.md&lt;/strong&gt; is an example of a Jekyll &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt;. It’s already linked in the header of your website, and you can customize its text by opening and writing in that file. We’ll cover adding more site pages in the &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-3&quot;&gt;next section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;css&lt;/strong&gt; folder holds CSS converted from SCSS that controls the visual design of the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;feed.xml&lt;/strong&gt; lets people follow the RSS feed of your blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index.html&lt;/strong&gt; controls the structuring of content on your site’s homepage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-pages-and-posts-a-idsection5a&quot;&gt;Writing pages and posts &lt;a id=&quot;section5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section will describe how to create pages and blog posts on your website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pages&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;posts&lt;/strong&gt; are just two types of written content that’s styled differently. Pages are content (like an “About” page) that isn’t organized or displayed chronologically, but might be included in your website’s main menu; posts are meant to be used for content best organized by publication date. The URLs (links) for pages and posts are also different by default (although you can change this): page URLs look like &lt;em&gt;MySite.com/about/&lt;/em&gt;, while post URLs look like &lt;em&gt;MySite.com/2016/02/29/my-post-title.html.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;authoring-in-markdown-a-idsection5-1a&quot;&gt;Authoring in Markdown &lt;a id=&quot;section5-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a way of formatting your writing for reading on the web: it’s a set of easy-to-remember symbols that show where text formatting should be added (e.g. a # in front of text means to format it as a heading, while a * in front of text means to format it as a bulleted list item). For Jekyll in particular, Markdown means you can write webpages and blog posts in a way that’s comfortable to authors (e.g. no need to look up/add in HTML tags while trying to write an essay), but have that writing show up formatted nicely on the web (i.e. a text-to-HTML convertor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won’t cover Markdown in this lesson; if you’re not familiar with it, for now you can just create posts and pages with no formatting (i.e. no bold/italic, no headers, no bulleted lists). But these are easy to learn how to add: there’s a handy markdown &lt;a href=&quot;http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown&quot;&gt;a Programming Historian lesson by Sarah Simpkin on the hows and whys of writing with Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. Check out these links if you’d like to format text (italics, bold, headings, bullet/numbered lists) or add hyperlinks or embedded images and other files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure any Markdown cheatsheets you look at are for the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html&quot;&gt;kramdown&lt;/a&gt;” flavor of Markdown, which is what GitHub Pages (where we’ll be hosting our website) supports. (&lt;em&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark/wiki/Markdown-Flavors&quot;&gt;various “flavors” of Markdown&lt;/a&gt; that have subtle differences in what various symbols do, but for the most part frequently used symbols like those that create heading formatting are the same—so you’re actually probably okay using a markdown cheatsheet that doesn’t specify it’s kramdown, but if you’re getting errors on your site using symbols that aren’t included in kramdown might be why&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be interested in “markdown editor” software such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typora.io/&quot;&gt;Typora&lt;/a&gt; (OS X and Windows; free during current beta period), which will let you use popular keyboard shortcuts to write Markdown (e.g. highlight text and press command-B to make it bold) and/or type in Markdown but have it show as it will look on the web (see headings styled like headings, instead of like normal text with a # in front of them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;authoring-pages-a-idsection5-3a&quot;&gt;Authoring pages &lt;a id=&quot;section5-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see an existing page on your website (created as a default part of a Jekyll website &lt;a href=&quot;#section3&quot;&gt;when you created the rest of your website’s files&lt;/a&gt;), navigate to your website folder and open the &lt;strong&gt;about.md&lt;/strong&gt; file either in a text editor (e.g. TextWrangler) or a Markdown editor (e.g. Typora) to see the file that creates the “About” page. Also click on the “About” link in the top-right of your webpage to see what the webpage the file creates looks like in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stuff between the -– dashes is called “front matter” (&lt;em&gt;note that opening the file in a Markdown editor might make the front matter appear on a gray background instead of between dashes&lt;/em&gt;). The front matter tells your site whether to format the content below the front matter as a page or blog post, the title of the post, the date and time the post should show it was published, and any categories you’d like the post or page listed under.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can change things in the front matter of a page:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;layout:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep this as-is (it should say page).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;title:&lt;/strong&gt; Change this to the desired page title (unlike posts, no quotation marks around the title). In the screenshot below, I added a page with the title “Resume”.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;permalink:&lt;/strong&gt; change the text between the two forward slash marks to the word (&lt;em&gt;or phrase—but you’ll need to use hyphens and not spaces!&lt;/em&gt;) that you want to follow your site’s main URL to reach the page. For example, &lt;strong&gt;permalink: /about/&lt;/strong&gt; locates a page at &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/yourwebsitefoldername/about/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The space below the front matter’s second — dashes (or below the front matter’s gray box, if using a Markdown editor) is where you write the content of your page, using &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-1&quot;&gt;the Markdown formatting described above&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a new page in addition to the “About” page that already exists on the site (and can be customized or deleted), create a copy of the &lt;em&gt;about.md&lt;/em&gt; file in the same folder (the main website folder) and change its filename to the title you wish, using hyphens instead of spaces (e.g. &lt;em&gt;resume.md&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;contact-me.md&lt;/em&gt;). Also change the title and permalink in the file’s front matter, and the content of the file. The new page should automatically appear in the main menu in the site’s header:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-22.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/resume/&quot;&gt;an example of a page&lt;/a&gt; on my demo site, or see &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandavisconti/JekyllDemo/gh-pages/resume.md&quot;&gt;the file that’s behind that page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;authoring-posts-a-idsection5-2a&quot;&gt;Authoring posts &lt;a id=&quot;section5-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Finder, navigate to your website folder (e.g. &lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt;) and the &lt;em&gt;_posts&lt;/em&gt; folder inside it. Open the file inside it with either a text editor (e.g. TextWrangler) or a Markdown editor (e.g. Typora). The file will be named something like &lt;em&gt;2016-02-28-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown&lt;/em&gt; (the date will match when you created the Jekyll site).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-19.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As with pages, with posts the stuff between the -– lines is called “front matter” (&lt;em&gt;note that opening the file in a Markdown editor might make the front matter appear on a gray background instead of between dashes&lt;/em&gt;). The front matter tells your site whether to format the content below the front matter as a page or blog post, the title of the post, the date and time the post should show it was published, and any categories you’d like the post or page listed under.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re going to write a second post so you can see how multiple posts look on your site. Close the &lt;em&gt;20xx-xx-xx-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown&lt;/em&gt; file that was open, then right-click on that file in Finder and choose “Duplicate”. A second file named &lt;em&gt;20xx-xx-xx-welcome-to-jekyll copy.markdown&lt;/em&gt; will appear in the _sites folder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click once on the &lt;em&gt;20xx-xx-xx-welcome-to-jekyll copy.markdown&lt;/em&gt; file name so that you can edit the file name, then alter it to show today’s date and contain a different title, such as &lt;em&gt;2016-02-29-a-post-about-my-research.markdown&lt;/em&gt; (use hyphens between words, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; spaces).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now open your renamed file in your text or markdown editor, and customize the following:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;layout:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep this as-is (it should say &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;title:&lt;/strong&gt; Change “Welcome to Jekyll!” to whatever title you’d like for your new post (keeping the quotation marks around the title). It’s the norm to make the title the same as the words in the filename (except with added spaces and capitalization). This is how the title will appear on the post’s webpage).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;date:&lt;/strong&gt; Change this to when you want the post to show as its publication date and time, making sure to match the date that’s part of the filename. (The date &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; time should have occurred already, for your post to show up.)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Delete the words “jekyll update” for now, and don’t add anything else here—the current theme doesn’t use these and they mess up the post URLs. (&lt;em&gt;Other themes can use this field to sort blog posts by categories&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The space below the second -– (or below the gray box, if using a Markdown editor):&lt;/strong&gt; This is where you write your blog post, using &lt;a href=&quot;#section5-1&quot;&gt;the Markdown formatting described above&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After saving, you should now be able to see your second post on the front page of your site, and clicking on the link should take you to the post’s page:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-20.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-21.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;strong&gt;the URL of the post&lt;/strong&gt; is your local website URL (e.g. &lt;em&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/em&gt;) followed by the year/month/date of publication, followed by the title as written in your filename and ending with .html (e.g. &lt;em&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/2016/02/29/a-post-about-my-research.html&lt;/em&gt;). Jekyll is converting the Markdown file you authored in the _posts folder into this HTML webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deleting a file&lt;/strong&gt; from the _posts folder removes it from your website (you can try this with the “Welcome to Jekyll!!” sample post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To create further posts&lt;/strong&gt;, duplicate an existing file, then remember to change not just the front matter and content inside the post as described above, but also the file name (date and title) of the new file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/2016/02/29/a-post-about-my-research.html&quot;&gt;an example of a post&lt;/a&gt; on my demo site, or see &lt;a href=&quot;http://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandavisconti/JekyllDemo/gh-pages/_posts/2016-02-29-a-post-about-my-research.markdown&quot;&gt;the code running that post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You now know how to add text pages and posts to your website. In this section. we’ll move your local site live so that others can visit it on the Web.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;At this point, we are making a version of your website publicly viewable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(e.g. to search engines and to anyone who knows of or happens on the link).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section1-2&quot;&gt;Earlier in the lesson,&lt;/a&gt; you installed the GitHub Desktop app. We’ll now use this app to easily move your website files to a place that will serve them to visitors as webpages (GitHub Pages), where the public can then visit them online. This first time, we’ll move all your website’s files to the Web since none of them are there yet; in the future, you’ll use this app whenever you’ve adjusted the website’s files (added, edited, or deleted content or files) on your local version of the website and are ready for the same changes to appear on the public website (there’s &lt;a href=&quot;#section6-1&quot;&gt;a cheatsheet at the end of this section&lt;/a&gt; for this).&lt;/em&gt;
1. Open the GitHub Desktop app. Click the &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; icon in the top left corner, and click on the “Add” option along the top of the box that appears (if “Add” isn’t already selected).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on the “Choose…” button and choose the folder (&lt;em&gt;JekyllDemo&lt;/em&gt; in my example) containing your website files (if on a Mac and unable to locate this folder, your Library folder may be hidden; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/mavericks-easily-make-user-library-folder-visible&quot;&gt;use these directions&lt;/a&gt; to make it visible so the GitHub Desktop app can look navigate inside it).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, click on the “Create &amp;amp; Add Repository” button (Mac) or the “Create Repository” button (Windows). You’ll now see a list of the files to which you’ve made changes (additions or deletions to and of files) since the last time you copied your website code from your computer to GitHub (&lt;em&gt;in this case, we’ve never copied code to GitHub before, so all files are listed here as new&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first field, type a short description of the changes you’ve made since you last moved your work on the website to GitHub (space is limited). In this first case, something along the lines of “My first commit!” is fine; in the future, you might want to be more descriptive to help you locate when you made a given change—e.g. writing “Added new ‘Contact Me’ page”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can use the larger text area below this to write a longer message, if needed (&lt;em&gt;it’s optional&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-23.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the top of the app window, click on the third icon from the left (it will say “Add a branch” if you hover over it). Type &lt;em&gt;gh-pages&lt;/em&gt; in the “Name” field, then click the “Create branch” button.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-24.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on the “Commit to gh-pages” button near the bottom-left of the app window.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-25.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on the “Publish” button in the top-right.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-26.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the popup, leave everything as-is and click the “Publish repository” button in the lower-right (&lt;em&gt;your window may not show the options related to private repositories shown in the screenshot&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-27.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click the “Sync” button in the upper-right&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages-28.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now visit (and share the link to!) your live website. The URL will follow the pattern of &lt;em&gt;your GitHub username DOT github.io SLASH name of your website SLASH&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, the author’s URL is &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/&quot;&gt;amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mini-cheatsheet-a-idsection6-1a&quot;&gt;Mini cheatsheet &lt;a id=&quot;section6-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future when you want to move changes you’ve made locally to your live site, just follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the GitHub Desktop app and type a short description of your changes (and optionally a longer description in the second text box).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the “commit” button underneath the text box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the commit has finished, click the “Sync” button in the top-right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give GitHub a little time to receive these changes (about 10-90 seconds) before refreshing your live site to see your changes there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-fancy-a-idsection7a&quot;&gt;Getting fancy &lt;a id=&quot;section7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This lesson won’t cover advanced work like changing the visual appearance of your site or adding new functionality, but here is some information to get you started on your own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-design-a-idsection7-1a&quot;&gt;Visual design &lt;a id=&quot;section7-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visual design of a website is often referred to as its &lt;em&gt;theme&lt;/em&gt; (more properly, a theme is a set of code and image files that together make a major change to the appearance of a website).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can customize the current theme of your website by making changes to the files in the &lt;em&gt;_sass&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;css&lt;/em&gt; folders (unfortunately, the most recent version of Jekyll’s move to use SASS instead of plain CSS makes learning to customize things a bit more difficult for non-designers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can add in (and further customize, if desired) a theme already created by someone else by searching for “Jekyll themes” or trying one of these resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alex Gil’s “Ed” theme for minimal digital editions (https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/, https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/documentation.html; free)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rebecca Sutton Koeser’s “Digital Edition” theme (https://github.com/emory-libraries-ecds/digitaledition-jekylltheme; free)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/&quot;&gt;Jekyll Themes&lt;/a&gt; directory (free)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.io/&quot;&gt;JekyllThemes.io&lt;/a&gt; (free and paid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;functionality-a-idsection7-2a&quot;&gt;Functionality &lt;a id=&quot;section7-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/&quot;&gt;Jekyll plugins&lt;/a&gt; allow you to add small bits of code that add functionality to your site such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PascalW/jekyll_indextank&quot;&gt;full-text search&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yihangho/emoji-for-jekyll&quot;&gt;emoji support&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/ilkka/710577&quot;&gt;tag clouds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to host your site on GitHub Pages as we did in this lesson, you can only use the Jekyll plugins already included in the GitHub Pages gem we installed (here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/versions/&quot;&gt;a full list of what you installed&lt;/a&gt; when adding the GitHub Pages gem to your Gemfile earlier).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you choose to host your Jekyll website elsewhere than GitHub Pages, you can use any Jekyll plugin (instructions to self-host vary by web host and won’t be covered here, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is a page about how to install plugins once you’ve set up your self-hosted Jekyll site). You can search for “Jekyll plugin” plus the functionality you need to see if one is available, or check out the “Available plugins” section near the bottom of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for a list of plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can keep GitHub Page’s free hosting of your Jekyll website, but give the site a &lt;strong&gt;custom domain name&lt;/strong&gt; (domain names are purchased for a reasonable yearly fee—usually around $10—from a “domain name registrar” such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/services/domains&quot;&gt;NearlyFreeSpeech.net&lt;/a&gt;). For example, the author’s LiteratureGeek.com blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages just like the site you built with this lesson, but it uses a custom domain name I purchased and configured to point to my site. Instructions on setting up a custom domain name can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;migrate an existing blog&lt;/strong&gt; from many other systems including WordPress, Blogger, Drupal, and Tumblr by following the links on the right side of &lt;a href=&quot;https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/home/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. When migrating a site, make sure to back up your original site in case it takes a couple tries to get posts living at the same URL as before (so search engine results and bookmarks don’t break).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cheatsheet-a-idsection8a&quot;&gt;Cheatsheet &lt;a id=&quot;section8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To test stuff locally&lt;/strong&gt; (new plugin, theme, how a new blog post looks):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start local site&lt;/em&gt;: Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt; at the command line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visit local site&lt;/em&gt;: Open &lt;strong&gt;localhost:4000/yourwebfoldername/&lt;/strong&gt; in a web browser (e.g. &lt;em&gt;localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/&lt;/em&gt;). Don’t forget the trailing slash!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;See changes on the local site as you make them:&lt;/em&gt; While the site is running, after making changes to website files: save the files and refresh the webpage to see the changes—&lt;strong&gt;except for the _config.yml file&lt;/strong&gt;, for which you must stop running the website and restart running the website to see changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stop local site:&lt;/em&gt; Hit &lt;strong&gt;control-c&lt;/strong&gt; on the command line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To move local changes to your live site&lt;/strong&gt; (new post, settings tweak, etc.):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the desired changes to your website’s local files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the GitHub Desktop app, make sure your website is chosen in the left sidebar’s list of repositories, and write your commit message summary (and description if desired).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click “Commit to gh-pages” in the lower left.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After the commit has completed, click “Sync” in the upper right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow 10-90 seconds for your changes to reach GitHub’s web servers, then visit your website and refresh the page to see your changes live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run into an issue, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/&quot;&gt;Jekyll has a page on troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; that might help. If you’re working on the command line and get an error message, don’t forget to try searching for that specific error message online. Besides search engines, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;the StackExchange site&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to find questions and answers from people who have run into the same problem as you in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Talking social web annotation at the Folger Digital Futures panel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Early modern DH projects have focused on things like transcription, tagging, and data mining of texts; what else can DH projects around Elizabethan plays, old recipe manuscripts, and other early modern content do? I was part of a Folger Shakespeare Library sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/nbrgcxg&quot;&gt;panel on “digital futures”&lt;/a&gt; at the Renaissance Society of American annual conference (4/1/2016) that discussed possible next steps, and I gave a brief talk about the opportunities &lt;strong&gt;social annotation&lt;/strong&gt; on such projects could support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-kind-of-annotation&quot;&gt;What kind of annotation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in letting modern readers add annotations to digital editions and similar textual projects. Where we may be used to pre-publication annotation by textual scholars, I’m interested in post-publication annotation by readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online, this often looks like dragging your cursor to highlight words or sentences and typing in your annotation (with an expanded audience of annotators, this might mean a comment, question, interpretation,contextualization, translation, illustration, locations, or something else…). Then, you can see that annotation plus the annotations of other readers displayed somewhere alongside the digital text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open, public social annotation hasn’t yet been as supported by DH projects as activities like transcription or tagging. Compounding this, I’m not an early modernist, so if anyone knows of early modern projects supporting public annotation, please let me know! You can check out non-early-modern examples in the NYPL’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://candide.nypl.org/text/&quot;&gt;Candide 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, or my own project at &lt;a href=&quot;http://candide.nypl.org/text/&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m especially interested in ways we can open up the conversations around literature to those outside universities, so I’m going to briefly talk about a couple ideas for social web annotation that serve reading audiences such as students and public enthusiasts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personalized--customized-annotated-editions&quot;&gt;Personalized &amp;amp; customized annotated editions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Letting readers and researchers filter the visible annotations on a digital edition to just those matching personal interests and needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we open texts to social annotation, even beyond basic moderation and curation to make sure annotations should be exposed to the public (e.g. that they’re not spam or off-topic…), we’ll quickly get more annotationson any page than most readers or scholars will want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By gathering metadata such as the date the annotation was authored, the subjects the annotation discusses (e.g. slang or religion), and the type of annotation (is it interpretation? a translation? an illustration?), we can begin to allow filtering what annotations are displayed to each reader’s needs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E.g.only show interpretations or contextualizations; don’t show translations; only show feminist readings; only show me annotations written by actors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E.g. a classroom version, first-time reader version, version accompanying a scholarly article annotating specific textual proof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll briefly mention a few other filters provided by social curation of a website’s annotations: voting (problematic!), flagging for usefulness, tagging by annotation affect (funny, thoughtful). These carry their own issues–you want to have readers see ideas that challenge them, and give a voice in the conversation around a text to people who haven’t been invited in the past, so the various ways you make social annotation practically readable are very much under experimentation and debate. It’s important that projects allowing annotation filtering are prepared to test, assess, and change their interface to better support their user communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;annotation-framework-as-an-interactive-introduction-to-textual-scholarship&quot;&gt;Annotation framework as an interactive introduction to textual scholarship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m imagining a kind of “Choose Your Own Edition” website that walks you through various locations of possible editorial intervention on a single interesting textual page, lets you choose from possible interventions or write in your own, and at the end recommends short writings and scholarly editions by editors who both strongly match and strongly oppose your line of reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a very basic level, this makes clear to readers that “editing” is additional things beyond transcription, and that transcription is a complex and critical activity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I wireframed “Choose Your Own Edition” during a seminar at the Folger Shakespeare Library taught by Dr. Jeffrey Masten, and I’m hoping to further prototype the idea in partnership with Dr. Liz Mercier, who has been working on paleography pedagogy through her own site at &lt;a href=&quot;http://purduepaleography.cla.purdue.edu/index.html&quot;&gt;http://purduepaleography.cla.purdue.edu/index.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, different groups of students might be assigned to read the same section of a digital edition, but with a different “editorial theory” filter turned on for each group. Class discussion could then explore how reading differed when supplemented by annotations coming from different schools of thought and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, after annotating scenes in a play, annotators could find out what kind of readings their annotations matched. E.g. did people into certain theories or readings tend to find certain passages especially interesting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see more digital editions in the future simply allowing post-publication social annotation, where annotation of a digital edition is an ongoing activity open to the public (or some subset, such as invited literature scholars), rather than just having finished digital editions containing annotations released to the public. Social annotations can let the conversation around a text grow and be iterative as new ideas, new performances, and new relevant events occur. Annotations can increase public interest in illustrative materials and lesser known texts. And perhaps most importantly, annotation can support participation and inclusion of citizen humanists.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making it public (a Knight Foundation News Challenge proposal)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Humanities research and publication should be more than just writing and printing polished monographs. I envision a humanities where born-digital publication lets us document and celebrate the entire research spectrum, with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; critical work (teaching, learning, discovery…) by&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; on campus interested in the humanities (students, staff, faculty at all levels…) using&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; methods for critical thinking (writing, coding, curating, annotating, visualizing…) and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; forms of “making public” (ebooks, blogs, interactive websites, code libraries, datasets…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…realized and made public through a university’s libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/KnightVideoSlide.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To realize this vision, I recently submitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/how-might-libraries-serve-21st-century-information-needs/submissions/making-it-public-a-more-public-humanities-by-co-evolving-the-digital-humanities-center-university-press&quot;&gt;a proposal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newschallenge.org/&quot;&gt;Knight Foundation’s News Challenge&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the Purdue University Press Director &amp;amp; Head of Scholarly Publishing Peter Froelich. The New Challenge will fund answers to the question “&lt;em&gt;How might libraries serve 21st century information needs&lt;/em&gt;?” (You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/how-might-libraries-serve-21st-century-information-needs/submissions/making-it-public-a-more-public-humanities-by-co-evolving-the-digital-humanities-center-university-press&quot;&gt;comment on our proposal here&lt;/a&gt;—proposals are currently undergoing public review, commentary, and updating.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/159821316?byline=0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/159821316&quot;&gt;Making it public: a more public humanities by co-evolving the digital humanities center &amp;amp; university press&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/user8389727&quot;&gt;LiteratureGeek&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-description&quot;&gt;Project description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pursue this goal through a collaboration of two Purdue Libraries units: the Digital Humanities Center and University Press. This proposal would fund a “co-evolving” of these partners towards a sustainable workflow for libraries to make all kinds of humanities work truly publicly accessible, welcoming, and participatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funds would support the Digital Humanities Center and Press using the coming year to focus on creating and testing best practices documents and workflows for humanities publication issues such as technical longterm sustainability, ethical crediting of project effort, and contracts that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;outline and support generative collaborations among the Libraries and diverse campus humanities researchers. This work would include the development of a physical space dedicated to experimental, collaborative, public digital humanities building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several test case research projects involving a variety of campus roles, research areas, methods, and publication forms would be pursued and fully publicly documented. These example projects would focus on several areas of humanities endeavor with broad impacts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;works aimed at broader, public audiences (the humanities as radically relevant and inviting)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;works supporting public interaction with and participation with research and learning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;works throughout the life cycle of research (not just polished monographs, but mid-state publishing during a project, blogging, dataset publication, digital dissertations…)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;broadly reusable work documenting research practices, workflows, and infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project deliverables are both the published, born-digital humanities publication that the collaboration will support, and the publicly documented model of co-evolving a digital humanities center and university press to make a campus’ humanities research radically more 
public (made available both as blogs on successes, failures, and experiments during the collaboration, and as a whitepaper after one year of collaboration). Finally, we’ll host a THATCamp unconference on “making the humanities public” at the end of the year, which will allow 
others interested in these goals to meet, exchange ideas, and plan future collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-this-project-advance-the-library-field&quot;&gt;How does this project advance the library field?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project explores a co-evolution of two areas of the library currently undergoing rapid digital changes, supporting university press born-digital publishing and digital humanities exploration. The project will both deliver real born-digital digital humanities publications, and also document and publicly share the model (workflows, best practices, failures, successes…) we use to achieve those publications. By creating regular blog posts on successes, failures, and experiments during the collaboration, and a whitepaper after one year of collaboration, we aim to thoroughly make public this project about making the humanities public, allowing other libraries to build off what we learn and use our collaboration as a model for jumpstarting their own partnerships toward a more public humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-the-audience-and-what-are-their-information-needs&quot;&gt;Who is the audience and what are their information needs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad humanities community at Purdue—especially those not traditionally enfranchised to experiment and publish their work—will benefit directly from the collaborative model explored by this project: undergraduate and graduate students in the College of Liberal Arts and School of Interdisciplinary Studies, department and Libraries staff, and faculty at all levels of contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the international humanities community can benefit from the public documentation of this project’s evolution, and citizen humanists will benefit from the creation of humanities publications aimed at inviting, welcoming, teaching, and learning with this under-served audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;team-members--their-qualifications&quot;&gt;Team members &amp;amp; their qualifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will be led by two units based in the Purdue University Libraries: the Digital Humanities Center and the University Press &amp;amp; Scholarly Publishing Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amanda Visconti, an Assistant Professor and the Digital Humanities Specialist in the Libraries, directs the Digital Humanities Center. Her background includes work at diverse digital humanities (DH) centers, including at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities in a variety of roles (2009-2015). She holds a literature Ph.D. and information master’s both focused on DH, and offers almost a decade of experience as a professional DH web developer. An active member of the DH community, Visconti was elected to the ACH executive council (2016-2020), runs a popular DH research blog (http://LiteratureGeek.com), and recently completed a wholly digital humanities dissertation with a central project (http://InfiniteUlysses.com) that has drawn over 20,000 unique visitors in its first year. Her unique mix of coding and design experience coupled with digital humanities scholarship supports this project’s creations of sustainable, ethical technical workflows for born-digital humanities publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Froehlich is the Director of the Purdue University Press and head of Scholarly Publishing Services at Purdue University Libraries. He brings to this project wide-ranging experience in the publishing world and a dedicated interest in innovating through born-digital publication. Froelich worked 2006-2010 at the Indiana University Press, and holds a B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley and an MBA from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Better tech via annotation (using Hypothesis to improve your technical documentation, code, and tutorials)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece originally appeared as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/blog/better-tech-via-annotation/&quot;&gt;a guest post on the Hypothes.is blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis makes inline annotation on any web resource possible: a visually small change from comment sections at the end of resources, but a change with a big impact. Whatever your relationship to tech, we’ve all been here: you’re reading through some technical resource (code, documentation, or tutorial) and something doesn’t work the way the page says it should. Maybe you want to add details or a better example; maybe you run into an error message or have a questions specific to your circumstances. Maybe you just want to let the author know “you lost me here”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tech resources where understanding succeeds or fails line-by-line instead of by paragraph or section, inline annotation—the ability to highlight specific text and discuss it right next to where it occurs—is a vast improvement. Even those resources with comment sections at the bottom have problems specific to that positioning, like low-quality comments stemming from commentators not responding to any actual statement on the page, or having trouble identifying where a tutorial lost them. In this post, I’ll cover how a community used Hypothesis to improve a technical resource: how we got our users involved, the types of annotations we observed, and how we’re working to automate the workflow from a new annotation to an improved tech resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-community-annotates&quot;&gt;A community annotates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a member of the digital humanities (DH) community—we’re builders, users, teachers, and thinkers around innovative digital tools for literature, history, and other cultural heritage fields (stuff like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/uncategorized/preserving-reconstructing-teaching-in-3d/&quot;&gt;3D printing for archaeology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://viraltexts.org/&quot;&gt;text analysis of historical memes in newspapers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;interfaces that let readers interpret and discuss challenging novels&lt;/a&gt;). During the first two weeks in February, &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricarchaeology.ca/about/&quot;&gt;Shawn Graham&lt;/a&gt; and I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/dhannotates&quot;&gt;#DHannotates&lt;/a&gt; tag to encourage DHers to switch from passively reading tech resources to actively annotating them via Hypothesis. We focused on one resource: the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;Programming Historian site&lt;/a&gt;, where novice-friendly lessons on DH tech skills like the following are &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/project-team&quot;&gt;authored, edited, and peer-reviewed by community volunteers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/cleaning-ocrd-text-with-regular-expressions&quot;&gt;Cleaning OCR’d [scanned and digitized] text with regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;, by Laura Turner O’Hara&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet&quot;&gt;Getting started with topic modeling and MALLET&lt;/a&gt;, by Shawn Graham, Scott Weingart, and Ian Milligan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources&quot;&gt;Visualizing historical networks&lt;/a&gt;, by Marten Düring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/corpus-analysis-with-antconc&quot;&gt;Corpus analysis with Antconc&lt;/a&gt;, by Heather Froehlich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Links to all Hypothesis-augmented versions of all the Programming Historian tutorials &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/amandavisconti/89edd34f998c35705409&quot;&gt;can be perused here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’d like developers to leave comments as they work through your documentation or code. Or maybe you want to support a wider user community. Questions during a tutorial? Ideas for improvements? Get stuck? Want to thank the tutorial’s writers and editors? Users can use Hypothesis annotation to add their thoughts and discuss a resource right in its margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;invite-your-users-to-interact-with-your-code-documentation-or-tutorials&quot;&gt;Invite your users to interact with your code, documentation, or tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to see the kinds of questions and suggestions for improvement Hypothesis enables your users to share? Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&quot;&gt;#DHannotates&lt;/a&gt; event drew annotations on tech tutorials such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/a/AVKjiwTOvTW_3w8LyrtI&quot;&gt;Short tips to avoid problems later in the tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/a/AVLRKEnQvTW_3w8Ly4k7&quot;&gt;Further examples of how you can customize a command&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/a/AVKjrSUbvTW_3w8Lyryw&quot;&gt;On tutorials written from a Mac/Linux perspective, notes on what Windows users should do differently&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/a/AVK7W2hnvTW_3w8Lyx3i&quot;&gt;Request for definitions for abbreviations used in the tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/182#issuecomment-183466725&quot;&gt;see a full list here&lt;/a&gt; of the types of feedback &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/dhannotates&quot;&gt;#DHannotates&lt;/a&gt; garnered on &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/&quot;&gt;the Programming Historian tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-get-my-user-community-interested&quot;&gt;How do I get my user community interested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stir up interest, we invited users of a specific resource (&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/&quot;&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;) from a specific user community (digital humanities) using Twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/dhannotates&quot;&gt;#DHannotates hashtag&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Slack&lt;/a&gt;. Two tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep the initial focus of your encouragement narrowed to a specific webpage or set of related resources.&lt;/em&gt; We’d love the DH community to annotate all our tech resources, but we decided to start with focus on just one website to keep involvement simple.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encourage people to try annotations &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt; by making it clear their thoughts will be read and responded to during the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Users may be more excited to immediately try out a specific experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Come learn markdown basics from &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;! And we’ll answer any issues you run into if you annotate the lesson this week.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then to remember there’s a new annotation tool to use, the next time they’re using your documentation or lessons and run into something they wish they could discuss. Tying annotation into involvement is a great way to attract and include new users in your tech resource’s community, too—annotation is a form of contributing that even those with little experience in your programming language can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis makes getting started annotating easy. The instructions we shared were simple enough to fit in a tweet or two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypothes.is/register&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create a Hypothesis account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prefix the URL of the webpage you want to annotate with https://via.hypothes.is/.&lt;/em&gt; That is, cut and paste that in front of the link to the page you want to annotate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annotate!&lt;/em&gt; It’s very intuitive: highlight the text you want to talk about using your mouse cursor, and then type in your comment or question. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/&quot;&gt;Hypothesis’ tutorial for student annotators&lt;/a&gt; for specific steps and pictures that show you everything you can do with annotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also published blog posts on the project for those who wanted &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&quot;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; or were interested from the standpoint of &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricarchaeology.ca/2016/02/02/can-we-fix-it-yes-we-can/&quot;&gt;a teacher seeking to support student tech learning in the classroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-someone-annotates-does-anyone-else-know&quot;&gt;If someone annotates, does anyone else know?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For #DHannotates, we encouraged annotation adoption by promising to answer questions during the weeks of the event—or if we couldn’t answer a question, we’d at least make sure the issue was recorded where a future volunteer could address it. Tactics for this included creating an issue in the Programming Historian GitHub repo, and trying to find people who can answer questions via Twitter and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inline highlighting made this much simpler than responding to a comments section at the end of each lesson. By focusing on a set of specific experiences (e.g. “Now’s the time to learn basic regular expressions and get feedback on any questions as you learn”), potential annotators were encouraged to make the step over the threshold into annotation as a habit, creating a Hypothesis user account and starting to read a new tech lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great thing about Hypothesis annotations is that annotations are helpful as-is. In cases such as users providing very specific use cases, further information for the curious, or thanks to the authors of a tutorial, some annotations can simply live in the Hypothesis sidebar. For other annotations that suggest a needed change, like reports of error messages or the need to update a tutorial for the latest version of Python, you may want to go further…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automate-annotations--improvements&quot;&gt;Automate annotations =&amp;gt; improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start getting annotations on your documentation or tutorials, you’ll want a workflow to capture and build on this community input. While there isn’t yet an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; Hypothesis channel, you can easily automate managing annotations using a feed. Hypothesis lets you follow RSS or Atom feeds of your annotations in two ways (just switch out the .rss for .atom if using the latter):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A stream of all annotations with a given tag (https://hypothes.is/stream.rss?tags=DHannotates)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A stream per annotated URL (e.g. https://hypothes.is/stream.rss?uri=http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-the-zotero-api)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow the latest annotations through your RSS reader, use a Slack RSS integration to post new annotations to a dedicated Slack channel, or create an issue for each new annotation in your GitHub issue queue to make sure the annotation gets looked at. If you’re concerned about cluttering your issues queue, check out the discussion of tactics among the Programming Historian and #DHannotates group happening on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/182&quot;&gt;this GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in trying Hypothesis with your own tech resource? Ideas, questions, and suggestions related to using Hypothesis to improve tech resources can be shared using the Hypothesis (&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hypothesis-forum&quot;&gt;general product&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hypothesis-users&quot;&gt;users forums&lt;/a&gt;), or by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues&quot;&gt;adding a GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Peer review for my Programming Historian lesson on Jekyll+GitHub Pages website creation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently submitted a new digital humanities work for peer review: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;” at the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. My lesson teaches you how to create and publish your own basic website or blog (which will look &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/&quot;&gt;just like this&lt;/a&gt; and be publicly accessible on the Web, for free!) using some popular tech (the Jekyll static site generator, and GitHub Pages for web hosting). The lesson attempts to walk you slowly through the process and not assume any previous tech knowledge, and explains why you might be interested in creating a website this way instead of using other tools. (&lt;em&gt;For what it’s worth, this blog you’re reading right now is run using the same tech as the lesson introduces—Jekyll and GitHub Pages!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I invite anyone interested in trying my lesson to share your thoughts as you follow the lesson.&lt;/strong&gt; Everything from ideas of things to add or highlighting parts of the lesson you liked, to “I got stuck here!”, “This sentence was confusing”, “I wish you’d explain why this step is necessary”, and “I understood this step, but I think someone with less of a tech background would be confused” is useful to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange for providing feedback on my lesson as you work through the lesson, during the next month (&lt;em&gt;through April 15, 2016&lt;/em&gt;) I will respond to any comments or questions from lesson users and &lt;strong&gt;I will personally try to make sure you can make it through the whole lesson&lt;/strong&gt; all the way to your own basic public website. (&lt;em&gt;Note: this lesson was originally Mac-only, but I just added and tested steps that should support Windows users as well. I haven’t coded on a PC in years, though, so I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to troubleshoot all Windows-specific issues&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;” to use the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-starting-the-lesson-two-alerts&quot;&gt;Before starting the lesson, two alerts:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will need a Mac computer with a decent internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the early steps of the lesson (&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#section2&quot;&gt;“Xcode” in the “Installing dependencies” section&lt;/a&gt;) requires you to download a piece of Mac developer software that &lt;strong&gt;may take 3-5 hours to download&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll want to budget separate times (30-60 minutes, then 60-120 minutes?) to start the lesson, then come back after that download completes and do the rest of the lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ways-of-sharing-your-feedback&quot;&gt;Ways of sharing your feedback:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email:&lt;/strong&gt; You can email &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; a list of your comments (maybe open the new email and add to it as you go through the lesson?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis annotation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;Follow this special link to my lesson&lt;/a&gt; (it’s the lesson link, prefixed with via.hypothes.is/) to add your feedback right to the lesson! You’ll need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypothes.is/register&quot;&gt;create a Hypothesis account&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have one (or log in), then highlight any words or sentence you want to comment on and type in your annotation (more info on why using Hypothesis annotation is awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&quot;&gt;back in this post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re comfortable with GitHub, you can visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/issues/3&quot;&gt;the peer review ticket for my lesson&lt;/a&gt; and leave your feedback as a comment on that issue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack:&lt;/strong&gt; Slack is a tool for online group chat; you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;join over 400 digital humanists on the Digital Humanities Slack via this link&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to checking out all the “channels” (chatrooms dedicated to discussing specific topics, like annotation and DH teaching), we can use Slack to chat in real-time as you work through the lesson (e.g. send me a direct message). If this is interesting you but you’re not familiar with Slack, let me know and I’m happy to show you how to get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always privately contact my PH editor &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#102;&amp;#119;&amp;#103;&amp;#105;&amp;#098;&amp;#098;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;Fred Gibbs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; by email with questions about the lesson or the peer review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-of-feedback-needed&quot;&gt;Type of feedback needed:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m seeking constructive comments—things that can help me make the lesson better and more accessible to users without a technical background. This includes places where you were confused, got stuck, quit, wanted more details, etc. I’m interested in both how I can make the lesson better for &lt;em&gt;you specifically&lt;/em&gt;, and how you think I could improve the lesson for other users (especially those who may not have as much digital experience as you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/reviewer-guidelines&quot;&gt;reviewer guidelines&lt;/a&gt; with more information about how to be a good, friendly reviewer and how their peer review process works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-programming-historian&quot;&gt;What’s the Programming Historian?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt; is a collaborative web project offering “novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research”. PH features “lessons” written by digital humanists; each lesson is a thorough, novice-friendly walk-through of not just how to use a specific digital humanities tool, but &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you might want to. As such, they’re not classroom lesson plans (though they can be used as part of one!), but rather a pedagogical form of research writing where the new knowledge produced by the writer is all about making a methodology accessible to new users. (&lt;em&gt;That’s how I’m explaining this work to my faculty review committee, by the way.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in finding out more about digital ways of engaging with the humanities, check out the &lt;em&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt;’s list of peer-reviewed lessons &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (they aren’t just for historians, by the way). They’re all fantastic lessons, and run the range from more foundational concepts like &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/preserving-your-research-data&quot;&gt;preserving research data&lt;/a&gt; (by James Baker) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/cleaning-ocrd-text-with-regular-expressions&quot;&gt;cleaning up digital text scanned from print books&lt;/a&gt; (by Laura Turner O’Hara), to methods of distant reading or a full set of lessons on learning the coding language Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially recommend Miriam Posner’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka&quot;&gt;Up and Running with Omeka.net&lt;/a&gt;” (if you’d like to create a website to show off a collection of digital or physical artifacts, like stuff from an archival collection or museum) or Matthew Lincoln’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/graph-databases-and-SPARQL&quot;&gt;Using SPARQL to access Linked Open Data&lt;/a&gt;” (if you keep hearing about how collections like “the &lt;a href=&quot;http://collection.britishmuseum.org&quot;&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.europeana.eu/api/linked-open-data-introduction&quot;&gt;Europeana&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americanart.si.edu&quot;&gt;Smithsonian American Art Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://britishart.yale.edu/collections/using-collections/technology/linked-open-data&quot;&gt;Yale Center forBritish Art&lt;/a&gt;” are publishing “APIs” or “linked open data” and want to know how this might be useful in your research/teaching).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1/editorial-sustainability-and-open-peer-review-programming-historian&quot;&gt;read more about PH’s peer review process in this “How did they make that?” article on the DH Commons journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
