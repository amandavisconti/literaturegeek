        <title>DH Job Talk (for my new role!): Scholars' Lab Managing Director</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m starting as Managing Director of the University of Virginia’s Scholars’ Lab digital humanities center later this spring! I shared &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;the job talk I did for my previous role&lt;/a&gt; after I was hired, and here I’ll do the same for this new position (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/announcements/are-you-our-new-managing-director/&quot;&gt;check out the job ad here&lt;/a&gt;). Where my previous job’s interview presentation asked me to comment on the broad trends in libraries + DH citing current literature, this talk asked for a discussion of my past projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The digital has the potential to be a disruptive force in humanities scholarship, giving scholars the means to critique, reimagine, and transform ideas, theories, material artifacts, and even interpersonal relationships. Using examples from your own collaborations with faculty, graduate students, and staff, please discuss how this disruption can be successfully embodied in scholarly inquiry, as well as in the cultivation of people and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve blogged the projects I shared in my talk (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHSlack&quot;&gt;DH Slack&lt;/a&gt;) in previous posts on this website, but I’m sharing the talk regardless as the overall framing of my projects in response to the prompt might be of interest to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When scholars share their job talks after being hired, DH and libraries interviewing processes become a little less mysterious. Academia has many genres of presentation. It can be difficult to draft your first job talk without seeing how others in your field translate a job ad’s requirements into a job talk’s expression of their unique expertise. &lt;a href=&quot;http://readywriting.org/uncategorized/faculty-development-for-the-21st-century-and-beyond/&quot;&gt;Lee Skallerup Bessette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://celestesharpe.com/onward/&quot;&gt;Celeste Tuong Vy Sharpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisbourg.wordpress.com/2015/07/12/infrastructure-and-culture-a-job-talk/&quot;&gt;Chris Bourg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/digital-humanities/in-out-across-with-collaborative-education-and-digital-humanities-job-talk-for-head-of-graduate-programs/&quot;&gt;Brandon Walsh&lt;/a&gt; all share successful DHy job talks on their websites (I shared the &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; for my previous faculty role, too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-presentation&quot;&gt;The presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.001.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My digital humanities is not disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.002.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption can be a force for good, especially against systemic problems. But to my ear, disruptive is not what I want DH to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption is inherently non-introspective; you disrupt others, rather than looking hard at yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption can ignore a history of similar work, and the humanities can’t afford that mistake. For example, a movement to make the humanities more public that ignored the fanfiction communities’ existing public humanities—people using the web to improve one another’s close readings and counterfactual interventions—would be deeply flawed. DH has diverse roots in pre-digital humanities scholarship, including highly recognizable non-digital, algorithmic criticism of the kinds Stephen Ramsay explores in his book &lt;em&gt;Reading Machines&lt;/em&gt;. We have much to gain by connecting our efforts today to what has worked in the humanities of the past, and to the humanities that also thrives outside academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.004.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I share some of my recent collaborative DH work with you today, I’d like us to consider this work not in terms of how it &lt;em&gt;disrupts&lt;/em&gt; the humanities, but through a variety of more positive and generative lenses. DH as…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An applied humanities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experimental&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public and participatory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A radically interdisciplinary humanities, embracing social science, science, and art&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open to any challenges to which we can bring our skills of humanities thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.005.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hopeful for the humanities Bethany Nowviskie has imagined in her work “&lt;a href=&quot;http://nowviskie.org/2015/on-capacity-and-care/&quot;&gt;on capacity and care&lt;/a&gt;”. Nowviskie cautions: “Please do not mistake [capacity and care work] for something idealistic and motherly and sweet. I offer care as a hard-nosed survival strategy… to increase the reach and grasp (which is at the root of the word “capacity”—the “capture”) of the humanities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing both the positive and negative sides of disruption, and turning to other concepts with different values, aren’t only reactions fueled by thinking these are good ways for a person to be in the world. There are significant gains for pushing our scholarship to be more intellectually generous, more locally interconnected, and better at crediting key emotional labor such as team-building and mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.004.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the next twenty minutes today, I want to tell you a bit about two of my recent DH projects, one where the bulk of the work is my own, and one where I’m only nominally the creator. This work articulates some of my hopes for what the digital humanities could be, a DH deeply part of the humanities rather than opposed to it, a DH that’s more interested in the right column up on the screen [&lt;em&gt;in the image above this paragraph, for blog readers&lt;/em&gt;]—in seeing innovation in maintainance, the quality rather than the quantity of impact, on “people over projects” (as the Scholars’ Lab puts it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.007.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first project I’ll discuss, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, shows humanities scholarly inquiry that’s been reimagined and opened beyond academia, rather than disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a textual scholar. I decided that instead of focusing on the scholarly editing aspect of digital editions, my skills and interest were more in line with work like that of Alan Galey, whose &lt;em&gt;Visualizing Variation&lt;/em&gt; project created code that lets editors of digital editions intervene in their texts in unique ways. Rather than creating a scholarly edition, I focused more on interface design aimed at opening a literary edition to a public audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.009.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked: What if we build a digital edition and invite everyone? What if millions of scholars, first-time readers, book clubs, teachers and their students, show up and annotate a text with their “infinite” annotations (that is, digital marginalia of interpretations, questions, contextualizations, and other comments)? How would we do that, and what would it do to the text and our understandings of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.010.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked through this speculative experiment, with its admittedly unlikely hypothetical of a massive public desire to read &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; online. But I also built a prototype that was immediately useful in exploring these questions, through the generous annotations and feedback of an actual, modestly sized community of readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; (at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;InfiniteUlysses.com&lt;/a&gt;), is a participatory digital edition of James Joyce’s challenging novel &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;. Its goal was to support a public conversation about the novel, bringing readers of different backgrounds into participating in the same discussion space. The design, code, usertesting, and thinking that went into this project doubled as my literature dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what reading a page on Infinite Ulysses looks like. There are three main activities you can pursue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While reading the novel, you can highlight parts of the text and annotate these with your questions, interpretations, reactions, translations, and other comments. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can also read the annotations created by other readers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And I tried, at a basic level, to personalize your reading experience by filtering the displayed annotations so that you could just be shown the ones that fit your needs, interests, and background. For example, a reader can choose to see the top-rated annotations first, or the newest annotations; or to not see any spoilers; or to only see annotations tagged as clues to the book’s mysteries, references to Irish politics, or jokes you might miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some solid interest in this approach. My work was cited in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; this past summer, drew around 13,000 unique visitors in its first month of beta testing, and drew over 25,000 unique visitors during its beta year (April 2015-2016), despite little intentional publicity after the first month. I share these numbers to show that there’s interest in this scholarship, but in doing so I feel uncomfortably close to getting caught up in the allure of large-scale impact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more important to me, and to the humanities, are the far smaller number of people who actually repeatedly visited and annotated &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; on the site. What matters is the students who hear about my dissertation and are encouraged to also pursue the most appropriate methods for their research questions. I care about my impact at the scale of individual readers, like the South Korean reader who found my edition more accessible for her translation and understanding. Or the 90-year-old retired man who wrote that he’d always wanted to read &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, and now he felt like he could take his laptop to a bar, pull up a stool, and maybe actually read the thing this time using my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.013.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other facets to the scholarship of &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, clear areas of research inquiry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 1st research question was an interdisciplinary DH one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can we design digital editions that are not just theoretically accessible to the public, but invite and assist public participation? And are there ways to design for meaningful public participation in literature, that don’t require the public to learn scholarly rhetoric?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 2nd question was from the field of information science:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can we design public DH websites to handle a huge influx of readers and annotations, so that individual user experience doesn’t suffer and diverse user needs are met? How would each user find the “signal” of the best annotations for them to read, from the noise of “infinite” public annotations?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 3rd question was from the field of literature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Textual scholars often create editions as their scholarship. By separating out historical textual scholarship values from how the editions realizing those values looked, can we imagine other forms still holding true to the values of our field? What can we learn by accepting scholarly editions as just one of many ways of embodying textual scholarship values?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.016.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m here to speak about collaborative DH today, and you might be wondering how a literature dissertation can be a collaborative rather than a largely solo activity. I did perform the full scholarly labor you’d expect from a literature dissertation—most people would agree successfully defending the dissertation and becoming a tenure-track assistant professor shows that. But beyond my dissertation-length work, the larger project around my dissertation relied strongly on collaboration and the intellectual generosity of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge number of people made Infinite Ulysses possible, so much so that I can’t name everyone right now, but I’ve put as many as possible up on the screen [&lt;em&gt;image above previous paragraph, and http://www.infiniteulysses.com/credits goes into more detail&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advisor Matt Kirschenbaum and committee members Neil Fraistat, Kari Kraus, Melanie Kill, and Brian Richardson are amazingly intellectually generous scholars. They met with me as a team regularly throughout the entire dissertation, which was hugely helpful in keeping everyone informed about and happy with the developing look of the dissertation. I also benefitted from the feedback of colleagues at the MITH DH center where I worked 2009-2015, such as Stephanie Sapienza and Ed Summers. Their questions, guidance, and encouragement were critical in realizing my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through social media, DHer Michael Widner at Stanford and I discovered we were working on similar tech (the Drupal annotator module). Despite being on opposite coasts, we Skyped to discuss our work, and he ended up generously allowing me to build on top of some of his Lacuna Stories project code that hadn’t yet been publicly released, allowing me to spend more time on a different piece of coding more closely tied to my research questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who visited Infinite Ulysses and shared annotations and/or feedback on the site are collaborators, too. The majority of the site’s annotations were authored by people other than me. Ten types of user testing, data gathering, and participatory design, with a variety of people, over the course of the site’s development, directly shaped the growth of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite Ulysses was a collaborative project with a large portion created by one person. Now, I want to tell you about a project that’s far more of a distributed and balanced collaborative, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHSlack&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.019.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is a social media platform that functions like a set of interconnected, themed chat rooms. Using the Slack platform, I created and manage the scholarly forum of the Digital Humanities Slack (or DH Slack). Started a little over a year ago, it now supports over 1,200 digital humanists through around 70 “channels” (thematic chat rooms on topics like libraries and the digital humanities, open access, data sharing, and various DH methods and theories). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.020.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH Slack is open to anyone with a curiosity about DH and/or related interests (e.g. digital libraries, museums, and archives)—those interested just visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;tinyurl.com/DHslack&lt;/a&gt; to join. Absolutely no DH expertise is required, and we have several specific channels devoted to DH beginners, students, job seekers, and asking all kinds of DHy questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.021.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH Slack is ““mine”” [&lt;em&gt;all the air quotes&lt;/em&gt;] in an extremely limited sense, if any. I set up the Slack, publicize its existence, moderate it, periodically started discussions (more in its early days than now), answer questions about using the Slack, and lead policy-making such as adapting a DH-specific code of conduct. That code of conduct covers things like not publicly posting screenshots of Slack conversations without first getting the consent of everyone shown in the shot, which is why I’m largely showing tweets rather than screengrabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.022.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five other DHers generously collaborate with me as additional Slack moderators: Alan G. Pike, Sam Abrams, Alex Gil, Ed Summers, and Paige C. Morgan. We take our code of conduct seriously, and have taken firm action when it’s been called for, to protect our community members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.023.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH Slack exists because of its members, who build a humanities community through their conversations and sharing. Even the most collaborative and democratic of teams needs one person to really be in charge of project management, and I feel like my current role with the DH Slack is similar—helping things along, being available and responsible should problems arise, and making the final call after group discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.024.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still figuring out how Slack can be useful to our scholarship: Can it allow different kinds of conversations than Twitter? On the screen, you can see examples of DHers moving between the Slack and Twitter to have different kinds of conversations—in that middle tweet, a technical discussion that was limited by Twitter’s format switched to the Slack to continue more freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.025.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our members work at non-profits or in K-12 teaching, or aren’t professionally involved in academics; some are undergrads or grad students. It’s clear that the Slack, like many other platforms, can support geographically dispersed collaborators. But can we use the Slack to teach and support people interested in DH who don’t know of any potential collaborators, don’t have mentors geographically near them, or who aren’t inside academia? For example, I’m hoping to do a Slack hangout this spring where I’ll be available on the Slack to help anyone who wants to work through &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;my &lt;em&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt; lesson on creating their own first research website&lt;/a&gt;. If DH mentors can periodically be virtually available to support questions about specific tech tutorials, maybe we can ease new DHers experimentation with digital methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting uses of the DH Slack I’ve seen so far include allowing remote participants at MITH’s recent “Night Against Hate” scholarly-activist hackathon, mentorship for new digital humanists, a place to connect regional DH networks such as in Tennessee, Baltimore, and Australia and languages such as Spanish, and as a space to expand Twitter conversations. We’ve been used as a model by other scholars for their own Slack instances, and I authored an invited guest post about the DH Slack for the London School of Economics blog this past summer. If you’d like a place to discuss and learn about the digital humanities, or a friendly place to ask questions, please join us via &lt;a href=&quot;http://TinyUrl.com/DHSlack&quot;&gt;TinyUrl.com/DHSlack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the DH Slack and Infinite Ulysses model a digital humanities that’s not disruptive, but different. Both take an experimental approach grounded on past humanities successes, whether that’s DH Twitter or speculative textual experiments like the Ivanhoe game or Prism. The experiments of both projects recognizably demonstrate humanities scholarship and community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both experiments also demonstrate my key interests. I’m deeply invested in DH design and building as a route to new knowledge, especially through interfaces for public, communal learning. And I’m keenly interested in the larger questions of how we make DH go: infrastructure and process, project management, and community-building. If you visit my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.LiteratureGeek.com&quot;&gt;LiteratureGeek.com&lt;/a&gt; blog, you’ll see that I share everything from theory and analysis, to my software and design decisions, how I get started planning a new project, and how my work space is set up. This is all as a way to think through not just the strategies, but also the daily tactics of successful DH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite Ulysses and the DH Slack are at two ends of the collaboration spectrum, but the bulk of my interdisciplinary collaboration experience actually happens quite differently, in project teams that regularly meet face-to-face (as with a group of graduate students I taught to work with the &lt;em&gt;Shelley-Godwin Archive&lt;/em&gt;) or over Skype (as with the BitCurator team).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.028.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in my current role as a DH librarian and faculty at Purdue Libraries, I enjoy a close working relationship with my colleagues in both Archives and Special Collections, and in our university press. Together, we’re using DH as the connector to build a workflow for campus DH research and teaching that runs from archival description and discovery, through scholarly communication and publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t cover this kind of collaboration in detail in this talk, as I suspect this kind of face-to-face collaboration is the most common and familiar. But, I’ll wrap up by listing on the screen a few of my more typically collaborative DH projects on the screen, and I’m happy to discuss these further in the Q&amp;amp;A or over email. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UVaJobTalkSlides/UVaManagingDirector.031.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New role: Scholars' Lab Managing Director</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m starting as Managing Director of the University of Virginia’s Scholars’ Lab later this spring! Academic Director Alison Booth wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/uncategorized/amanda-visconti-is-our-new-managing-director/&quot;&gt;a lovely post about my hire on the Scholars’ Lab blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/SLphoto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scholars’ Lab is a digital humanities center at the University of Virginia Libraries, and a founding member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcenternet.org/&quot;&gt;CenterNet&lt;/a&gt; international network of DH centers. The Lab has &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/people/&quot;&gt;an amazing team of DH experts&lt;/a&gt; (including new Head of Graduate Programs &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/walshbr&quot;&gt;Brandon Walsh&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/about/charter/&quot;&gt;a team-authored charter&lt;/a&gt; I deeply respect, and past and current work including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neatline.org/&quot;&gt;Neatline&lt;/a&gt;, “a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/&quot;&gt;Speaking in Code&lt;/a&gt;, a symposium of advanced DH developers discussing tacit DH tech knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://praxis.scholarslab.org/&quot;&gt;Praxis Program&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://praxis-network.org/&quot;&gt;Network&lt;/a&gt;—innovative models of DH student training, where students have collaboratively created projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://prism.scholarslab.org/&quot;&gt;Prism&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/&quot;&gt;Ivanhoe reboot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/&quot;&gt;experimental humanities Makerspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leadership Alliance Mellon Initiative (LAMI) fellows (supporting minority students interested in graduate studies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even more work captured in this 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/uncategorized/whats-the-scholars-lab/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Alison Booth and on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/research/&quot;&gt;Scholars’ Lab research page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m deeply honored to join and excited to work with the Scholars’ Lab team and community, and looking forward to being back in the VA/MD area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2017/02/23/scholars-lab-dh-center-managing-director-job-talk&quot;&gt;next post on this blog&lt;/a&gt; will share the job talk I gave while interviewing for this role, and you could also check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;my previous role’s job talk&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested in interviewing for DHy positions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DH 2017 Long Paper &amp; Panel Acceptances</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dh2017.adho.org/&quot;&gt;DH 2017&lt;/a&gt; is the annual international digital humanities conference, held this August 2017 in Montréal. I’ll attend the annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://ach.org&quot;&gt;ACH&lt;/a&gt; executive council meeting then, and also present twice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My “&lt;strong&gt;Less intent, more impact: Transforming public DH projects toward access, care, and inclusion&lt;/strong&gt;” talk was accepted as a long paper (see below for abstract). Among other thinkers mentioned in the abstract, the focus on a specific DH project’s social impacts was inspired by Mark A. Matienzo’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://matienzo.org/2016/to-hell-with-good-intentions/&quot;&gt;To Hell With Good Intentions: Linked Data, Community and the Power to Name&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Hack, Yack, Stack: Access, Culture, and DH Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;”, a panel I’m on with Laura Braunstein (Dartmouth College Digital Humanities Librarian) and Thomas Padilla (University of California Santa Barbara, Humanities Data Curator) was also accepted. We’ll be interviewing one another on our varied experiences with and definitions of developing DH infrastructure within libraries, with lots of space for audience conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;long-paper-debriefing-the-infinite-ulysses-project-towards-a-socially-just-digital-humanities&quot;&gt;Long paper: Debriefing the Infinite Ulysses project towards a socially just digital humanities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The abstract I submitted, followed by responses to the (very helpful—thanks, anonymous reviewers!) reviewer comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good intent carries no guarantee of a positive impact on the world. For digital humanities designers and makers building projects that face or involve public audiences, we have an extra scholarly and human responsibility for all the repercussions of our work. Focusing not on what we mean to create, but on how our work could both positively and negatively affect others, enables a more caring, accessible, and inclusive DH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper uses my design, coding, and user testing of the participatory digital edition of James Joyce’s challenging novel &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses (InfiniteUlysses.com)&lt;/a&gt;, to demonstrate a public DH project designed with care for its impact on both its audience and the DH community. More importantly, I’ll explore how ethical design considerations such as increasing accessibility and inclusion can be added or increased in existing projects that may not have explicitly built these values in from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a public digital humanities project that has drawn over 25,000 unique site visitors, as well as a smaller body of 775 readers who created user accounts to interact more closely with the digital edition through annotation and other social features. &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is also the bulk of a unique, successfully defended, no-chapters literature dissertation, and as such those interested in the future of humanities graduate education may enjoy this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building the &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; digital edition helped me separate the scholarly values of textual scholarship from the common embodiment of these values (i.e. the scholarly digital edition or SDE). Through this clarification, I imagined new types of digital edition that, while different from SDEs, hold true to the same values performed by SDEs. Through building and testing the public use of one of these new models for reifying textual scholarship values, I experimented with designing an edition that is not just publicly accessible, but also invites and assists public participation in the scholarly love for a text’s materiality, history, and meaning. On the spectrum of crowdsourcing engagement, I located multiple paths for meaningful public DH activity that fall between the endpoints of full critical rhetoric and “adding a tag”. To enable this public engagement, I explored ways of designing participatory digital editions to adeptly handle an influx of public readers and their annotations, and tested suggestions on what scholars can learn about digital editions and their texts from the accompanying influx of website use data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Femtechnet scholars’ recentering of DH on ethical questions around technology design led me to connect the fields of textual scholarship and human-computer interaction, porting concepts of humane and ethical digital design to the domain of literary editions. Michael Muller’s formulation of participatory design as a “third space” connecting two audiences helped me support both scholarly and public edition readers in “challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal (many-voiced) dialogues across and through differences“. Katie Shilton’s exploration of how the design of a technology shapes the social values and ethics of its users helped me plan toward a community of annotators that would care for, rather than compete against, one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My post-dissertation work on &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; pulls in thinking from libraries and information science. Librarian Chris Bourg argues that neither technology nor knowledge infrastructures such as libraries can be neutral, and that therefore we must leverage both toward, rather than away from, social justice. Archivist Jarrett M. Drake calls us to move beyond current institutional archives to build knowledge structures that let us “unlock our futures as humans, as community members, as archivists, and as memory workers”, and suggests design that encourages perceptions of community belonging as a way forward. Digital Library Federation Director Bethany Nowviskie asks, “Can we position our digital collections and digital scholarly projects more plainly not as statements about what was and is, but as resources for the building of different, better worlds?” The knowledge infrastructure of libraries and archives ports well to that of digital editions, as well as to DH more broadly. Each of these thinkers push us to create work that would take us from what DH is to what DH can be; in this presentation, their arguments act as direct prompts for exploring small ways of designing toward a better DH through the specific use case of &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper quickly paints a cohesive picture of the &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; project, &lt;u&gt;instead spending the bulk of its time&lt;/u&gt; critiquing the impact of the project on its users and on the DH community. In “Do Artifacts Have Ethics?”, Michael Sacasas proposes a series of questions to be asked by anyone making something of what they’re making—whether that’s building an app, designing a class, or in this case designing and coding a digital humanities project. I use Sacasas’ provocations to examine the successes, failures, and difficult decisions of &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;’ design, &lt;strong&gt;walking the audience through concrete examples of what I did, what I should have done, or what I could do to make the project have an even better impact on the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a positive impact on &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;’ users: I provided my annotators with the ability to export their textual annotations from my website, giving them ownership and control over the results of their labor, and not forcing them to risk losing their work if my site crashed or closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a negative impact on &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;’ users: I tried to populate the digital margins of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; with the characters in the book, by letting new users choose among illustrations of the novel’s characters for the avatar that accompanies their textual annotations. The makeup of Joyce’s text means that those avatars were largely white and male, with three white female options, a cat, and no other identities. For a text that already struggles with instances of sexism, racism, and transphobia, making new readers feel “I’m not represented here, I’m not supposed to be here” was an additional negative impact that should have easily been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a positive impact of &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; on the DH community: I demonstrated that a public DH project could support meaningful public participation that didn’t necessitate bending public questions, interpretations, and other comments on &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; to fit the mold of scholarly rhetoric. By both successfully designing for public participation (my edition was cited in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; as a means for readers to make sense of the novel) and performing innovative humanities scholarship through that design (the project received my university’s 2016 award for arts and humanities distinguished dissertation), I added to the digital humanities’ long and ever-growing list of examples of how building can itself be critical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a negative impact of &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; on the DH community: I deepened digital editions’ duplication of the problems with the print literary canon, by building a project around another canon text and author. When only 11 of 86 projects funded by the NEH Preservation &amp;amp; Access Office 2006-2011 had a topic other than a white male writer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryancordell/status/409050747666706432&quot;&gt;Jessica DeSpain&lt;/a&gt;), I struggle with whether the positive public impacts of my work are worth deepening our problems with authorial representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I act as my scholarship’s own harshest critic not to paralyze other DH builders from ever making anything, but to make visible specific examples of how in small ways, by adding the skill of care to the skill of critique, we makers can build a better DH and a better world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responses to reviews:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear framing of the &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; project is necessary before leading the audience through the project’s ethical considerations and how these might extend to other DH work. The long paper format would allow me time to ensure the audience comfortably understands this case study project, before I embark on exploring its implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my careful grounding of the &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; case study, I will survey the critical DH cultural scholarship that grounded my assessment of the ethical impact of my work (e.g. Deb Verhoeven, Roopika Risam, Moya Bailey, Amy Earhart), as well as scholarship in related areas such as libraries feminist interface design (e.g. Bess Sadler, Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, Shaowen Bardzell and Eli Blevis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By combining my specific &lt;em&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; case study and this survey of critical DH, I can spend the rest of my talk exploring a sampling of how I addressed my project’s ethical challenges, while also relating these decisions back to broader best practices that future DH projects and scholars might reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Theming Jekyll: Customizing the look of your GitHub Pages-hosted, Jekyll-generated website</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’d like an entirely free, easy-to-maintain, preservation-friendly, secure website over which you have full control—such as a scholarly blog, project website, or online portfolio—using Jekyll and GitHub Pages is a good option. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;a peer-reviewed lesson that will get you started&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org&quot;&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (which is a really cool site full of peer-reviewed &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons&quot;&gt;lessons&lt;/a&gt; for lots of digital humanities skills and methods). My lesson, like many of the lessons at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org&quot;&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, assumes no technical knowledge and is specifically aimed at people who haven’t coded or created a website before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That lesson takes you through publishing a basic website that will look much like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/&quot;&gt;demo website&lt;/a&gt;. If you enjoy the lesson and want to further customize the look of your website, this blog post will help you do that! (&lt;em&gt;This post assumes you’ve read &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;my lesson&lt;/a&gt; already.&lt;/em&gt;) Thanks to Daniel Akacki for motivation to write this post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theming&quot;&gt;Theming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;my lesson&lt;/a&gt;, “theming” means changing the visual appearance (and sometimes behavior, like adding a comment section or a new menu) of your website. “Styling” is often used to mean changing a site’s appearance through CSS (the language that tells a browser how to display things, much like HTML tells a browser how to structure content on a page); “theming” more often means that you’re achieving styling through not just changes to existing CSS, but by reusing, customizing, or creating a set of multiple files that change the site’s visual appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you dive into learning CSS, you can simply reuse (and then tweak or more heavily customize) any of the many existing themes for Jekyll-generated sites. &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/&quot;&gt;The Jekyll Themes site&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start looking for free themes, and most of the themes have a demo website set up so you can navigate around a site using the theme and really get a feel for how it would look on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/4510&quot;&gt;Jekyll moved recently&lt;/a&gt; from themes that consisted of just adding files to your site folder (some CSS, HTML layouts, images, Javascript, etc.), to themes that you install as Ruby Gems (the way you already had to install Jekyll plugins). This is useful in some ways (e.g. improvements the theme creator makes to their theme can be updated on your website just by your updating the gem), but it can also be confusing for people who aren’t familiar with Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I explain how I took the website you should have at the end of &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;my lesson&lt;/a&gt;, and changed the site to have a new theme. This isn’t the only way to theme, but I think it’s currently the easiest way if you’re new to web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;switching-to-the-hacker-theme&quot;&gt;Switching to the “Hacker” theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be switching to the “Hacker” theme, for which &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker&quot;&gt;you can find the code here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jekyllhackertheme.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Jekyll-generated GitHub Pages site using the Hacker theme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set up a duplicate of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo&quot;&gt;https://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo&lt;/a&gt; site I created for my lesson&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;at &lt;a href=&quot;https://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemoThemed&quot;&gt;https://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemoThemed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so that we’re starting from where &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;my lesson&lt;/a&gt; left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker&quot;&gt;https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker&lt;/a&gt;, clicked on the green “clone or download” button on the right, and choose to download the files as a ZIP and then unpack the ZIP (usually doubleclicking the ZIP icon will do this).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made a copy of my original site files elsewhere, then deleted everything &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; my website folder (/JekyllDemoThemed)—but not the folder itself. I then pasted in everything &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; that unpacked ZIP folder—rather than pasting in the whole folder and its contents.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We made a copy of your original files so that we can later paste in any posts or pages you want to keep from your original site.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A skippable aside, if you’re interested:&lt;/em&gt; Making a copy of your website files before deleting them actually isn’t a huge need, since if you’ve followed my lesson you already have those files committed on GitHub, and can always go back to that or other earlier versions of your site (it’s just more hassle, which is why we’re making a local copy instead). Also, you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; keep your original site files as-is and just add in the needed files (and/or code inside files) from the theme, but as someone newer to Jekyll it might be difficult to figure out which files need to be changed and which can stay, which is why we’re instead starting from the theme ZIP and importing anything from your original site you want to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the terminal, cd into the website folder. For my file setup, that meant entering &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd /Volumes/Vault101/Documents/GitHubGeneral/JekyllDemoTheme&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script/bootstrap&lt;/code&gt;. Let it finish running.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open your _config.yml file and paste in the following (replacing &lt;em&gt;/JekyllDemoThemed&lt;/em&gt; with the name of your website folder):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baseurl: &quot;/JekyllDemoThemed&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;url: &quot;localhost:4000&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paste in the /_posts folder from that copy you made of your old site (if you want the posts from the old site). Paste in the pages from the old site (&lt;a href=&quot;http://about.md/&quot;&gt;about.md&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://resume.md/&quot;&gt;resume.md&lt;/a&gt;) if you want them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These pages and posts from the old site reference a layout file that existed for the Minima theme (the theme that your first Jekyll site defaults to), but not for the Hacker theme. So, you need to open each page and change &lt;strong&gt;layout: page &lt;/strong&gt;to &lt;strong&gt;layout: default&lt;/strong&gt;, and open each post and change &lt;strong&gt;layout: post&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;layout: default&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using the default text in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://about.md/&quot;&gt;about.md&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://resume.md/&quot;&gt;resume.md&lt;/a&gt; files I used in my demo site, you need to erase two bits of code from each of these pages. Erase &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;icon-github.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;username=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;jekyll&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; from both pages and erase &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;icon-github.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;username=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;jekyll&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; from both pages. (The Minima theme knew how to handle those calls to include icon images, but the Hacker theme doesn’t, so they will make your site not run.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hacker theme doesn’t automatically add pages to a header menu (like the Minima theme did), but you can still access your pages by typing in their URL, e.g. by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemoThemed/about&quot;&gt;https://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemoThemed/about&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://about.md/&quot;&gt;about.md&lt;/a&gt; page. You can also add links to these into your theme or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://index.md/&quot;&gt;index.md&lt;/a&gt; page. I often try to find another theme that has a feature I want—such as a fancy header menu—and then copy and paste pieces of its code into my site by trial and error. &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/&quot;&gt;The Jekyll Themes site&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to look, and trial-and-error copying and pasting from other themes is a great way to get more familiar with how your site works.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should do it! You can compare your site look and files with mine, if needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new demo site using the Hacker theme: &lt;a href=&quot;https://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemoThemed/&quot;&gt;https://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemoThemed/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Buying digital humanities hardware (a proposal for an archival DH 3D scanner and 3D printer)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Early last year, I wrote a (successfully funded!) proposal for my department (Purdue Libraries) to purchase 3D scanning and printing equipment dedicated to archival digital humanities research. This was in response to a call to appropriately use some outstanding funds remaining in an equipment-funding account; the audience was department administration. I’m sharing the proposal now &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/meta-dh/&quot;&gt;as part of a series of posts documenting practical, administrative, and infrastructural work that makes DH go&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in possible DH applications of 3D printing, or more generally in researching and making a case for DH equipment, I hope this post is useful to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/BigTicketRequest_DigitalHumanitiesArchival3DSetup.pdf&quot;&gt;You can see the actual PDF I submitted here&lt;/a&gt;, if you prefer reading that to the blog post transcript below (it includes the budget and cost comparisons I didn’t feel like reformatting to paste into the blog text).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to start any proposal with a summary—this one has too long of a summary, and too long of an overall document. I was new to how the department handles purchase requests, and wanted to preemptively answer expected questions (e.g. you can see that I’m both trying to explain what 3D technology does and why purchasing it for open maker space service wasn’t my initial goal). I now try to keep reports and requests to a single page that’s easily skiable for key points like cost, value, and timeline, but I think this writeup might still be useful to someone seeking to familiarize their team with DH uses of 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes:&lt;/em&gt; Redactions are summarized [in brackets]—these are things where specific names were involved or ideas that we might want to use in competitive grant proposals. The “ASC” is Purdue’s Virginia Kelly Karnes Archives &amp;amp; Special Collections.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;General plans for the 3D Setup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IT support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ASC support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Budget&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why not use the Engineering Library 3D setup?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examples of possible projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summarydefinition-of-3d-terms&quot;&gt;Summary/definition of 3D terms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I propose a dedicated setup for digital humanities 3D &lt;em&gt;scanning, modeling, and printing&lt;/em&gt; as research and
teaching:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D scanning&lt;/strong&gt; lets you capture a three-dimensional digital model of an object such as a spacesuit or a model plane (much like a flat scanner lets you capture a two-dimensional model of a book page).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D modeling&lt;/strong&gt; uses that scanning to create a digital object you can manipulate, label, and otherwise augment on a computer. (&lt;em&gt;3D models don’t necessarily need to be printed to be useful; for example, we could scan a model airplane propeller and then create a digital animation of the propeller in use.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D printing&lt;/strong&gt; produces three-dimensional physical, tangible objects representing either actual artifacts or visualizations of data:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artifacts:&lt;/strong&gt; Print out in plastic (or other materials) a three-dimensional copy of the original object (or a miniature, magnified, or otherwise altered version) for display and handling, further research (e.g. with previously hard-to-decipher engravings or texture), and experimentation (e.g comparison of behavior of historical airplane propellers by printing and powering miniature versions).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital files can also be created from scratch to produce 3D visualizations such as timelines, graphs, globes, and scale models (e.g. create a 3D model of a historic satellite orbit that can be viewed from multiple angles).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH Center’s 3D printing setup would support &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt;, with a focus on how to best scan, digitally model and animate, and print facsimiles of archival and humanities artifacts for research and teaching use. Much of our time will be spent experimenting with scanner, printer, and software settings to produce accurately representative 3D models, and it is critical that researchers have full access to the equipment to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requested funding:&lt;/strong&gt;  $7596.98 (see budget below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;  Amanda Visconti (aviscont@purdue.edu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-plans-for-the-3d-setup&quot;&gt;General plans for the 3D Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial internal experimentation:&lt;/strong&gt; A one-year initial trial period will focus on experimenting with ASC artifacts suggested by the archivists, and on documenting best practices for creating accurate and useful digital and physical facsimiles for use in further DH research and teaching.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DH project use:&lt;/strong&gt; After this trial period, we will also begin to support humanities projects around campus that require our specific setup rather than the Engineering Library’s current printing service (e.g. a history class where students digitally “repair”, extend, label, or animate historicalartifacts using a computer). This outreach will be on the same case-by-case basis as other collaborative projects proposed to the DH Center, rather than as a drop-in service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External collaborations:&lt;/strong&gt; [grant project idea]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup will be located in the future DH Center; until that space is inaugurated, the setup will be located
in the DH Specialist’s office (table along the wall opposite the door).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-support&quot;&gt;IT support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT for the setup will be entirely supported by the Digital Humanities Specialist (installation, support, maintenance). The DH Specialist would develop a contract with Libraries IT to record this understanding.
This is an excellent test case to create a workflow for DH in the libraries that includes DH control and
support for software, hardware, and policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;asc-support&quot;&gt;ASC support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have discussed a possible 3D setup with [colleagues] in the ASC, and they have helped me identify specific artifacts and collections that would benefit from 3D support. We will collaborate on a workflow for secure handling and scanning on any ASC artifacts to be scanned, and think about how future ASC processing workflows might include capturing 3D digital model files of artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;budget&quot;&gt;Budget&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research into appropriate equipment included speaking with humanists doing archaeological and archival
3D work at [institutions]. We’re attempting to strike a balance between the cheapest options (assuming in the short run we’d need to upgrade to intermediate options, costing more total) and highest grade options (e.g. the $25k Artec Spider might one day be useful, but I’d want several years of prior 3D work, successful class and research use, and external funding for an investment that large). &lt;strong&gt;Total requested: $7596.98.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/BigTicketRequest_DigitalHumanitiesArchival3DSetup.pdf&quot;&gt;For the budget table and cost comparisons, see this PDF of the request (pasting it into the post was taking too much time).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future possible costs that will be supported from DH Specialist startup funding and other sources:&lt;/em&gt; protected cart for bringing artifacts from ASC; blue painter’s tape for printing bed improvement, sink for cleanup; ventilation/fan; table covering; dedicated computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, cables; lockable space for storage; shared ASC+DH graduate research assistant to assist with project design, 3D work, training others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-not-use-the-engineering-library-3d-setup&quot;&gt;Why not use the Engineering Library 3D setup?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Libraries already supports a 3D &lt;em&gt;printing&lt;/em&gt; setup in the Engineering Library, but for various reasons this is not adequate for digital humanities &lt;em&gt;scanning, modeling, and printing&lt;/em&gt; work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of our research focus with the dedicated 3D setup will revolve around calibrating and customizing the setup to create accurate, representative facsimiles of historical artifacts, which requires DH and ASC experts to have hands-on oversight of the process. 3D printing setup in the Engineering Library is designed as a &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt; producing finished print-outs to those who submit files, rather than letting you calibrate settings and experiment to make the most representative facsimile for your given research use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DH research use necessitates iterative experimentation; the listed wait time for a print from the Engineering Library setup is up to a week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transporting rare and fragile artifacts safely and securely from the ASC is simplified by keeping the equipment in-building. Future ASC processing workflows might include capturing 3D digital model files of artifacts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This expertise will allow experimentation focused toward publishing best practices for &lt;em&gt;humanities&lt;/em&gt; research, without competition from other (e.g. STEM) uses of existing equipment and without needing to constantly recalibrate from others using the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples-of-possible-projects&quot;&gt;Examples of possible projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas that could be developed into full lesson plans, courses, or collaborative DH projects seeking external funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General classroom use&lt;/strong&gt;. The 3D setup will allow students to have a dedicated space to explore digital interactions with the objects in ASC’s rich collections, where humanities students and faculty could experiment directly with the machines while getting archivists’ support in handling items and negotiating file/image reuse/sharing/copyright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A classroom module would be designed around scanning some of the more interestingly structured Flight/Space Archive artifacts, such as Neil Armstrong’s model of a lunar landing module. Students would then be able to access, extend, and handle these artifacts extensively without damaging the original artifact and with options such as printing magnified versions of an object to better assess its texture and structure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[A specific professor’s] course around writing historical material object analyses currently asks students to write about a speculative archival artifact; we could support students creating and printing these speculative artifacts, possibly by combining digital files of real artifacts into a chimera object.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use 3D facial models for a direct connection with historical personages that would be otherwise difficult to gain, beginning with our John Purdue death mask. [Possible research project idea.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How close can we get 3D models and printing to the originals?&lt;/strong&gt; Teaching archival concerns around authenticity, materiality, and representation (e.g. presentation differs depending on what significant property you’re focusing on) through experimentation with equipment calibration, materials, and post-printing processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can 3D scanning and modeling improve current archival processing workflows?&lt;/strong&gt; Augment existing digital collection items with 3D files; interactive 360+ degrees animations of artifacts; packaged lesson plans for K-16 including videos explaining archival artifacts, their details, differences in models, and possible discussion questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students “adopt” significant artifacts to explore multiple paths of documenting, describing, narrating, and the metadata and narratives they create are incorporated into the archive for future learners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we meet the need for archival facsimiles?&lt;/strong&gt; Meet the need for exhibits around Purdue and ASC history for external institutions (e.g. recent Indianapolis Symphony exhibit), the West/Lafayette community, and Purdue’s 2019 dual 50th moon landing / 150th Purdue founding anniversaries. Create facsimiles for hand-outs at Libraries and Alumni events, to pique interest in humanities projects and ASC collections (e.g. wearable facsimiles of Amelia Earhart’s flight goggles, possibly with add-on to hold smartphones a la Google Cardboard and display related Purdue history projects or apps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tangibility.&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to touch and manipulate objects and representations of data inspires the curiosity and questions of learners. Additionally, tangibility adds accessibility to visualizations, timelines, maps, and graphs for the visually challenged. Building on existing museum work allowing visitor access to facsimiles (e.g. the Art Institute of Chicago offers a range of sculpture with which visitors can feel the differences of various materials and compare the effects of erosion over time), we will attempt to make the learning and research outcomes of tangible access to artifacts more rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving active participation with research involving rare and fragile artifacts.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to increasing access to artifacts, 3D scanning and printing would allow those without archival training to directly handle a fragile object like Neil Armstrong’s model lunar lander module, experiencing first-hand detail, dimensions, and texture. But students could do much more than just touch these artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digital 3D versions of, for example, the lunar module model can be explored on a computer: magnified to better see details (the Smithsonian was actually able to read eroded engravings on old armor by scanning the armor and then manipulating the scan file on a computer), included in animated tutorials (historical airplane propellers and windflow; orbit paths), labeled and cross-sectioned, and digitally manipulated (e.g. students could see what a statue missing a piece would look like in its complete state, or digital files for objects on which colors had faded or washed away could be colored again).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These same activities could also happen with the printed-out plastic copy of an artifact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to off-campus artifacts.&lt;/strong&gt; The purchased scanner will be reasonably mobile, so that scans of artifacts held off-campus (e.g. in museums in an astronaut’s hometown) can be made when ASC staff visit them, then brought back to campus and printed so that a class can tangibly experience a remote artifact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Copies of these artifacts could be printed here on-demand when a class requires, and kept for future use by the teacher of that class (we could also provide storage to “check out” already printed versions of artifacts, but we expect teachers will like having their own copy of a few key artifacts to use frequently in their own teaching).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving world access to Purdue’s artifacts.&lt;/strong&gt; Purdue Libraries could host downloadable 3D image files of some of our ASC’s artifacts; we’d begin by identifying 5 key objects that are some combination of highly interesting and difficult for non-archivists to access (rare, fragile, not well represented by photograph).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Grant project idea]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific ASC collections or artifacts tagged for projects include:&lt;/strong&gt;  a 3D tour of the ASC vault, pliable/wearable 3D print of the lunar glove, Earhart flight suit, historical planes/propellers, artists’ books, Armstrong lunar lander module model. Anything that is fragile, rare, dangerous (lunar dust, jet fuel…) in the ASC—things that students or even researchers can’t currently touch or see. Anything in the ASC that would benefit from a cross-section (even if the insides don’t exist or can’tbe scanned, because these can be digitally modeled) or demonstration of them item in context and/or in use (historic propellers).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Designing a Digital Humanities Initiative: Background &amp; Campus DH Survey</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m designing a digital humanities (DH) initiative here at the Purdue University Libraries, and “initiative” means our whole vision for DH, support for which is now enshrined as a specific point in our department strategic policy. To kick off &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/meta-dh/&quot;&gt;a series of blog posts&lt;/a&gt; covering this infrastructure and community design work I’ve been up to, this post provides some background to the policies and plans I’ll be sharing in later writing, as well as a some of the findings of the campus DH climate survey I conducted over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-role--the-purdue-libraries&quot;&gt;My role &amp;amp; the Purdue Libraries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a digital humanities assistant professor and specialist librarian in the Purdue University Libraries. The Libraries here is its own department, including faculty who can teach in other departments. We don’t have an academic program of our own for listing courses within the Libraries, and I don’t believe anyone has a required teaching load. The norm for our faculty and many of our professional staff is to frequently teach/co-teach formal courses, or to do other sorts of teaching and training like leading skill workshops or visiting classes to present “one-shot” lectures on a specific topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;purdue&quot;&gt;Purdue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purdue is a Big 10 research university located in West Lafayette, Indiana (an hour northwest of Indianapolis, three hours south of Chicago). My role is focused on designing and realizing our DH initiative (as well as pursuing personal research and achieving tenure, but as my interests tend to community design and infrastructure these days, both parts of the role overlap). I started the role last August—you can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;my job talk&lt;/a&gt; in this post, and here’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/assets/DigitalHumanitiesSpecialist.pdf&quot;&gt;the ad for the position&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dh-in-the-purdue-libraries&quot;&gt;DH in the Purdue Libraries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purdue has past and existing DH activity, such as History Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blackdigitalhum&quot;&gt;Kim Gallon&lt;/a&gt;’s extensive work including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackpressresearchcollective.org/&quot;&gt;Black Press Research Collective&lt;/a&gt;, recent NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in DH on &lt;a href=&quot;Space and Place in Africana/Black Studies&quot;&gt;Space and Place in Africana/Black Studies&lt;/a&gt; co-organized with Hamilton Professor Angel David Nieves, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/55&quot;&gt;recent chapter in &lt;em&gt;Debates in DH.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Another DHer is English Professor Dino Felluga, whose work includes Victorian textual scholarship and the development of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.branchcollective.org/&quot;&gt;BRANCH Collective&lt;/a&gt; as a scholarly publishing alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent DH hiring.&lt;/strong&gt; Libraries department was deliberately slow in hiring for DH, instead waiting and observing as these roles began to proliferate at other institutions. Waiting a bit let the department identify problems with those roles’ designs as these issues became more obvious and slightly more avoidable. The Library Loon’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://gavialib.com/2011/12/the-c-word/&quot;&gt;Coordinator Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;” seems to be a frequent complaint of the solo DH “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elotroalex/status/709495906790408194&quot;&gt;Miracle Worker&lt;/a&gt;” hire (to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elotroalex&quot;&gt;Alex Gil&lt;/a&gt;’s term), and Miriam Posner’s piece &lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/money-and-time/&quot;&gt;on DH shortstaffing&lt;/a&gt; and its resulting tiring out of DHers identifies a widespread issue. The Purdue Libraries were able to address some of these issues in the job ad (it’s a tenure-track faculty position, so the research background they required is rewarded by strong support for continuing to do that research), and awareness of other issues is helping me not overextend myself or my scope for the DH we commit to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A healthy department&lt;/strong&gt;. Because Purdue Libraries has a strong ethos of collaboration over service from the dean on down, I’ve been able to enter into reasonable collaborations based on my assessment of projects and people, rather than feel pressured to fulfill all service requests. I deliberately gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;my job talk here&lt;/a&gt; on why a collaboration rather than a service model for our DH would be better for everyone, to gauge what their valuing of collaboration meant. The dean’s first comment after I completed my talk was to encourage me to move &lt;em&gt;even closer&lt;/em&gt; to the collaboration end of the collaboration-service spectrum than I’d articulated. It’s empowering to be enfranchised to say “no” to requests that aren’t appropriate to your role or that you don’t have time for, and to define the scope of your role and the DH group you represent. I wish more departments relied enough on the expertise of the DHers they hire to allow these experts to define the terms of their role, and to define where the department’s funding and hiring abilities limit what they can accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-a-libraries-dh-initiative-basic-questions&quot;&gt;Designing a Libraries DH initiative: basic questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culmination of my first eight months on the job was to present a proposal for just what we should be doing with our DH initiative (this will be shared in my future posts!). The user testing and project management aspects of my DH experience helped me address questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we (as Purdue Libraries, and as a DH initiative inside the department) &lt;strong&gt;define ourselves&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than letting others define us?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the same time, how do we &lt;strong&gt;listen to and acknowledge others needs for DH&lt;/strong&gt;? How do we responsibly and ethically solicit feedback and advice on campus DH needs? (As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/774225208676872193&quot;&gt;a librarian&lt;/a&gt; and as a human, I hope I respect the right to privacy and full informed consent in any whose behavior we want to study.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are many existing and potential audiences for DH on campus, and many desires for what DH can do for those audiences. &lt;strong&gt;We can’t be everyone’s DH&lt;/strong&gt;, and trying to do so will make sure we fail at doing particular things well. We need to balance among doing specific kinds of DH well, and connecting and encouraging people and projects on campus that advance other aspects of DH. How do we define a limited scope for the DH we do?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we communicate what our DH means to campus? What kind of public policies and workflows can we design to &lt;strong&gt;communicate what we do and don’t do&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can we define ourselves not just with some over-general definition of DH (e.g. “we support innovation in humanities via digital scholarship”), but instead &lt;strong&gt;envision the DH we want to work toward&lt;/strong&gt;—making that vision our mission? How do we &lt;strong&gt;stay honest to the values we think we hold by acting on them&lt;/strong&gt; through policies for the kinds of collaboration, education, and other efforts we focus on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of last year, I’ve constantly reshaped how I answer these questions as I learned more about Purdue’s current and past DH culture, resources, and scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;campus-dh-survey&quot;&gt;Campus DH survey&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep notes on the campus interactions that are part of my role—who I talked to, the conversation topic, the date. These notes are useful for tenure and review purposes (e.g. I can say how many DH consultations I provided in a term, and what departments I’ve been reaching; and I can remember what we talked about or project ideas we brainstormed when we pick up the thread weeks or months later). I’m currently using a Google Spreadsheet for this, but I’ve heard of others using business CRMs (customer management software) to keep track of their campus interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These interaction records let me take a year of talking and listening (and sometimes asking direct questions about what people want for campus DH) and aggregate these conversations into an overview of our current DH climate on campus, identifying…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;campus-strengths-to-build-on&quot;&gt;Campus strengths to build on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We already have a number of existing strengths right on campus for doing DH well:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Libraries department has a strong commitment to &lt;strong&gt;collaboration over service&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. our dean encourages Libraries faculty to collaborate on grant projects with other campus faculty as PIs or co-PIs). From successful collaborations like the IMPACT Program and two rounds of Mellon funding for “grand challenge” research teams that must include a campus librarian, the campus is already aware of us as potential collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been pre-emptive in &lt;strong&gt;defining&lt;/strong&gt; what the Libraries is, rather than letting pre-conceived notions of what a campus library does shape our strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my first conversations with my colleagues, we’ve discussed our DH initiative as providing an interdisciplinary space where we help train people to spread DH knowledge; connect, amplify, and record existing DH; and support other campus communities in imagining and implementing their own local DH. I feel supported in trying at most to develop &lt;strong&gt;a campus hub for DH, rather than trying to hoard (or be all) DH&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our strategic plan includes improving information &lt;strong&gt;access, diversity, and inclusion&lt;/strong&gt;, so my desire to focus on a DH advancing these goals is tied into our department’s founding document. (&lt;em&gt;More on this in later posts on identifying our values and translating these to policies and projects&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many units and roles already exist in the Libraries that support &lt;strong&gt;areas overlapping or adjacent with DH&lt;/strong&gt;, such as our humanities specialist librarians, Digital Programs, Research Data,  our three repositories (PURR, e-Pubs, and e-Archives), the Purdue University Press and Scholarly Publishing Services (which are situated within the Libraries), our Engineering Library’s makerspace, Archives and Special Collections resources and staff research and teaching expertise, a GIS Specialist Librarian and GIS Analyst, and Libraries IT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are strong &lt;strong&gt;collaborations among these Libraries units&lt;/strong&gt;, too, such as previous course co-taught by the Head of Scholarly Publishing and a faculty librarian where students published a print book based on research in the Archives and Special Collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these collaborations were &lt;strong&gt;perfectly set up to add a DH component&lt;/strong&gt;; in particular, collaborating with my colleagues in our Archives and Special Collections and our University Press and Scholarly Publishing Services has helped us work toward a better ASC-&amp;gt;DH-&amp;gt;Press workflow. We’re now exploring how we can make research and teaching with our ASC collections and experts flow into DH teaching, research, and publication forms, and how do these both have a natural extension to the Press’ interest in innovative scholarly communication and born-digital publication?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A history of &lt;strong&gt;well-known and well-funded campus DH research&lt;/strong&gt;: in particular, History Professor Kim Gallon’s and English Professor Dino Felluga’s respective grants-winning scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative work with other campus DH faculty&lt;/strong&gt; from the start of my job, including successfully co-PIing two grant proposals during my second month here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;decent faculty interest in DH&lt;/strong&gt; in our liberal arts and interdisciplinary studies departments (e.g. ~25 CLA faculty attended a meeting on DH despite it being held during the end of term).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest from these departments in DH’s contribution to &lt;strong&gt;alternative academic career&lt;/strong&gt; mentorship and teaching for students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of &lt;strong&gt;past courses on or including DH&lt;/strong&gt;, and a number of past courses taught, co-taught, or otherwise supported by Libraries staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The university’s Honors College as &lt;strong&gt;a space for Libraries faculty to propose and list their own courses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing student DH activity&lt;/strong&gt;, such as graduate student independent projects and GA work, student DH and tech working groups in several humanities departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;campus-needs-dh-might-address&quot;&gt;Campus needs DH might address&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also identified areas where the Libraries DH initiative can address campus needs, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DH is happening on campus, but largely among collaborators who found each other by chance rather than some kind of DH collaboration support network or center. We don’t yet have a DH Center or other entity that &lt;strong&gt;connects DH on campus&lt;/strong&gt;, to help researchers make connections to other people, get feedback on ideas, or mentorship around learning DH. I’m proposing we act as this connecting hub both through a virtual DH@Purdue website and through a physical space (a DH lab that may eventually become a center).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resource linking existing or past campus DH projects as well as &lt;strong&gt;modeling different DH project method and publication possibilities&lt;/strong&gt; is needed. (That DH@Purdue website I mentioned.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have a place safekeeping &lt;strong&gt;institutional memory for DH&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. no one can easily answer how many DH courses have been taught in the last decade). It can be difficult to &lt;strong&gt;communicate DH workshops, events, or course listings&lt;/strong&gt; to everyone who might be interested in these offerings. (That DH@Purdue website, as well as starting communication sources like the #PurdueDH hashtag, a listserv for event announcements and collaboration requests, and an RSS feed for new DH resources as I add them to the website, mostly directly from DH Twitter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could do more to develop and participate in &lt;strong&gt;regional DH&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. with IU, IUPUI, Notre Dame, Ball State), and particularly with IUPUI’s HILT training and THATCamp Indiana. (E.g. inviting speakers, attending nearby events, conference calls with set topics, creating a regional channel on &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;the DH Slack&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our digitized resources could use DHer input to identify the kinds of metadata and processing that would make &lt;strong&gt;DH teaching and research reuse&lt;/strong&gt; easiest. Some of our digitized resources are well-used, but in ways that suggest addition of DH methods such as an annotation framework could further support this use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students and faculty want easy ways to create websites that include maps, timelines, and annotation. I’ve heard interest in learning Omeka, Neatline, and Scalar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with funding for DH projects but without technical experience or interest, not knowing &lt;strong&gt;where to find skilled collaborators&lt;/strong&gt; with these characteristics is an issue. (The College of Liberal Arts started a directory of student workers with IT skills in the past, but it proved difficult to keep up-to-date.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some CLA faculty and students aren’t aware of how they might benefit from some Libraries resources, which are sometimes &lt;strong&gt;pitched toward a STEM audience&lt;/strong&gt; or use terms unfamiliar to humanities scholars (e.g. our repository for research datasets has few humanities collections). Part of my work will be translating what our various units, experts, and resources offer to humanists and DHers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to address findings like these, while at the same time &lt;strong&gt;encouraging other departments to fully invest in DH&lt;/strong&gt; through their own hiring and policies. For example, some of the DHy needs I heard expressed were more oriented toward IT service or digital pedagogy expertise, and the best solution would be making our advice available for those departments during their job design and hiring process for such positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-dh-response-to-this-campus-survey&quot;&gt;A DH response to this campus survey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/meta-dh/&quot;&gt;meta-DH&lt;/a&gt; post will discuss identifying the values and goals for our DH initiative, and how those translated into my initial proposal to the department. Thanks for reading, and let me know any questions &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek&quot;&gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Meta-DH, or Designing and Building a DH Initiative</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/meta-dh/&quot;&gt;starting a “meta-DH” series of blog posts&lt;/a&gt; to document my work developing a digital humanities initiative here in the Libraries at Purdue University. This work includes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;figuring out what our DH could and should be&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating a DH physical space (center? lab? something else?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the practical considerations of layout and budgeting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;designing policies and infrastructure for the initiative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building DH projects both to test our policies and to model the kinds of scholarship our methods realize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturegeek.com&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; before, you might have noticed that I enjoy blogging and other user-friendly &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/advice-tutorial/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; of DH scholarship. This style of writing helps me think, with the bonus that sometimes that thinking is useful to others. Blogging can also lead to feedback on resources I should check out, potential collaborators, and what I’m doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first year on the job meant writing a lot of GoogleDocs and other semi-private stuff: taking notes on meetings and consultations, recording ideas for projects, and explaining my plans to administration. To communicate more clearly (and use my colleagues’ generous donation of their reading time well), I summarize—meaning I generate a lot of documentation that hasn’t reached anyone else yet. I think the non-condensed versions of these ideas could be useful to someone. Thus, this series of posts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/28/DHjobtalk&quot;&gt;The job talk that put me in this role (already blogged earlier this year)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating the website for our DH initiative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/09/11/designing-digital-humanities-initiative-background-campus-survey&quot;&gt;What I learned during my first year in this role: doing a campus DH survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making good time &amp;amp; resource investments while designing campus DH&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How I’ve interpreted my job description&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with my faculty review committee to receive credit for my various kinds of DHy scholarship&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Daily practices (my office setup, software used, consultations, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DH program identity and choosing what to call our initiative (center? lab? should we even have a physical space?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My formal DH initiative proposal to department administration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designing and following through on a DH mission statement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partnerships and collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defining DH scope&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designing timelines and funding requests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a DH space: layout, equipment, budget&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grant proposals and sustainable models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s something not on that list you’d like to read about, let me know on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot;&gt;@literature_geek&lt;/a&gt; or by email aviscont@purdue.edu.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching with Omeka (DH consultation notes)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I provide DH consultations via email or in person, I try to also share the resources mentioned as a blog post here when they seem broadly useful. These notes aren’t representative of everything available on a topic, just some info for those new to a topic getting their feet wet. See this blog’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/advice-tutorial/&quot;&gt;advice category&lt;/a&gt; for more posts with advice and tutorials, and let me know if you’d like more in-depth resources around a specific DH topic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the best online lessons I know of are these two on the peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons&quot;&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; website: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka&quot;&gt;Up and Running with Omeka.net&lt;/a&gt;” by Miriam Posner, followed by “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit&quot;&gt;Creating an Omeka Exhibit&lt;/a&gt;” by Miriam Posner and Megan R. Brett. These do a thorough walkthrough of setting up and filling out your Omeka website (and include frequent screenshots!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you know where you want students to create their websites?&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve found the easiest thing is having each student create an account on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omeka.net/&quot;&gt;Omeka.net&lt;/a&gt; using the free plan (500MB storage, 15 available plugins that add extra site features, and 5 themes that change the look of your site). An Omeka.net account gives each student a free Omeka website (at something like mycustomtitle.omeka.net) , plus &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.omeka.net/&quot;&gt;lots of documentation&lt;/a&gt; for any questions that come up. Some examples of Omeka.net sites are &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.omeka.net/showcase/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that Omeka.net is different from Omeka.org&lt;/strong&gt;; Omeka.net lets you build Omeka sites right on the Omeka.net website, while Omeka.org is the Omeka code, which you can download and on your own server to have more control and customization options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more in-depth project where students would want to be altering Omeka code, installing the code on their own web server, using plugins (things that add features like commenting) or themes (change the look of your website) not available on Omeka.net, or purchasing and using a more customized domain name (MyCustomSite.com instead of MyCustomSite.omeka.net), you’d want to explore the resources on Omeka.org. This is considerably more technically intensive than using Omeka.net and is comparable to running your own WordPress blog instead of using WordPress.net (if you’re familiar with those). But! For both Omeka options (.net and .org), there’s amazing and thorough documentation, user forums, and tutorials focused on teaching with Omeka; you just need to decide how much effort you or your students want to devote to web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do choose Omeka.org&lt;/strong&gt;, your university IT may or may not be willing to install the code for you on your free university web space (like Drupal or WordPress, Omeka requires not just web code but a database). If the cost is not prohibitive, I highly recommend considering pointing students to &lt;a href=&quot;https://reclaimhosting.com/&quot;&gt;Reclaim Hosting&lt;/a&gt; instead; this gives them greater control over their website, especially after they graduate or otherwise leave the university. Reclaim has &lt;a href=&quot;a $25/year option&quot;&gt;a $25/year option&lt;/a&gt; that includes excellent custom service knowledgable about academics’ needs, a free custom domain name (e.g. MyCoolOmekaSite.com), and installation of Omeka at the push of a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few additional resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amanda French’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandafrench.net/2013/11/12/introduction-to-omeka-lesson-plan/&quot;&gt;Omeka lesson plan&lt;/a&gt; (detailed outline for what to cover in class when introducing Omeka)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Miriam Posner’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/&quot;&gt;How did they make that?&lt;/a&gt;”, a blog post showing several DH projects (including an Omeka one) and explaining in non-technical language the tools and work involved in creating each project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/files/docs/OmekaWorkshopTipSheet.pdf&quot;&gt;This Omeka PDF&lt;/a&gt; has links for understanding Omeka terminology like metadata and Dublin Core&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://teachinghistory.org/digital-classroom/tech-for-teachers/25115&quot;&gt;This lesson&lt;/a&gt; at TeachingHistory.org is another option for getting started with Omeka&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeffrey W. McClurken on “&lt;a href=&quot;http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/teaching-with-omeka/26078&quot;&gt;Teaching with Omeka&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/codex/Teach_with_Omeka&quot;&gt;Some examples&lt;/a&gt; of Omeka class projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sheila Brennan’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/blog/2013/08/20/back-to-school-edition-use-omeka-in-your-class/&quot;&gt;Omeka resource roundup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alexandra Bolintineanu’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://omekagym.omeka.net/about&quot;&gt;Omeka Gym&lt;/a&gt;, a website collecting Omeka assignments, resources, examples, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more excellent Omeka resources out there, so if you’re seeking help with something specific, consider an online search to turn up the many Omeka-focused teacher’s blog posts and presentation, then posting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.omeka.org/&quot;&gt;Omeka’s support forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Digital Humanities What, Why, &amp; How (DLF eResearch Network Talk)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I gave the following talk on the what, why, and how of digital humanities to the Digital Library Federation (DLF) Research Network on July 20, 2016 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clir.adobeconnect.com/_a960001693/p9qmqw2b9w5/?launcher=false&amp;amp;fcsContent=true&amp;amp;pbMode=normal&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clirdlf/eresearchnetwork/blob/master/syllabus-ern-2016.md#digital-scholarship-digital-humanities-data-visualization&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt;). The audience was librarians interested in digital things, but this talk is broadly applicable; if you’re a grad student or thinking about becoming one, though, you might also be interested in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/grad-advice/&quot;&gt;posts on doing DH as a student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;on my now-completed DH literature dissertation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m going to share my personal answers to some related digital humanities (or “DH”) questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what&quot;&gt;What is DH?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#why&quot;&gt;Why can DH be good for my work, for my department, and for my university?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how&quot;&gt;How can I get started in DH?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide01.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing DH definitely is: overly defined. The website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.WhatIsDigitalHumanities.com&quot;&gt;WhatIsDigitalHumanities.com&lt;/a&gt; currently offers over 800 definitions of DH submitted by DH practitioners. Definitions of this field maybe aren’t hugely helpful in understanding it, but I’ll start with one anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide02.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital humanities takes the work already done in the humanities (that is, research, teaching, and learning in areas like literature, history, and the arts; everything related to our past and present cultural heritage). But! It does this work in digital ways, such as making and using computer software, websites, and mobile phone apps to teach, or to help researchers and learners…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide03.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nuance of this definition is that DH is not just about using digital tools and methods and formats in humanities work; it’s also about applying humanities thinking to the digital. For example, a DHer might think through what a feminist social media platform would look like, or look for the hidden interpretative work that goes into creating a shiny map of political opinions in America. What gets represented, and why? What gets elided and glossed over?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StewartVarner&quot;&gt;Stewart Varner&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stewartvarner.com/2016/01/what-dh-could-be/&quot;&gt;a great blog post&lt;/a&gt;) points out that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://viraltexts.org/&quot;&gt;Viral Texts project&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryancordell&quot;&gt;Ryan Cordell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasmiq&quot;&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of this kind of DH. They’re using an algorithm to discover texts that were routinely reprinted in 19th-century historical newspapers—that is, discovering historical memes! After discovering where and how texts were reprinted and passed along among newspapers, they’re applying non-digital literary scholarship to studying why these texts were reprinted, and what their paths of dissemination might mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide04.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third nuance of what DH is, is that it’s as much about a distinct community and its values, as it is about DH methods and output (check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mkirschenbaum&quot;&gt;Matthew Kirschenbaum&lt;/a&gt;’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/kirschenbaum_ade150.pdf&quot;&gt;What Is Digital Humanities and What’s It Doing in English Departments?&lt;/a&gt;”). DH is defined by communities of practice, whether those are of shared methods, research questions, values, or something else. I’ll show you some examples of those values in just a moment, but I do want to say that when I talk about DH community, my view is limited by my own experience, which has included a specific subset of DH using Twitter, and the projects and people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/&quot;&gt;MITH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://chnm.gmu.edu/&quot;&gt;CHNM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarslab.org/&quot;&gt;Scholars’ Lab&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhsi.org/&quot;&gt;University of Victoria’s DHSI&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhinitiative.org/&quot;&gt;DH Initiative at Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, and other groupings where I’ve either worked, attended an event, or used a tool or project created by that grouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples always help me, so I’ll discuss three particular DH projects in more depth a little later in this talk. When I was getting started in DH, though, the thing that helped me feel like I had an understanding of this weird amorphous interdisciplinary field, was just to hear about a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of different projects, and spend some time being &lt;em&gt;gobsmacked&lt;/em&gt; by the many things doing DH could mean. So I’m going to zip through a handful of the many many things DH can be right now, before going into any level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide17.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DH can look like…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the University of Michigan’s team work on increasing digital access to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lib.umich.edu/islamic/&quot;&gt;Islamic manuscripts&lt;/a&gt;, where scholars have digitized texts’ pages and commenters can add scholarly transcriptions and annotations to help others understand these texts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coding &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/braille/&quot;&gt;a WordPress plugin that translates blogs into Braille&lt;/a&gt;. I was on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/research/braillesc/&quot;&gt;a team of DHers led by Tina Herzberg, George Williams, and Jen Guiliano&lt;/a&gt;, who realized that so much DH thinking is shared on WordPress blogs, and that creating some code that made blog writing simple to convert into Braille output could help in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/3-1/making-the-digital-humanities-more-open-modeling-digital-humanities-for-a-wider-audience/&quot;&gt;making the digital humanities more open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/research/the-documentation-and-preservation-of-dance/&quot;&gt;a project&lt;/a&gt; that explored digital ways choreographers could notate and preserve historical dance performances (team included &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dougreside&quot;&gt;Doug Reside&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/silkroadstudio&quot;&gt;Elisabeth Kvernen&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;archaeological work excavating old buildings and recreating these lost locations as &lt;a href=&quot;http://nico-digitalarchaeology.blogspot.com/2012/09/catalhoyuk-2012-and-4d-gis.html&quot;&gt;virtual 3D spaces &lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nicolo_dellunto&quot;&gt;Nicolo’ Dell’Unto&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhinitiative.org/projects/shgis&quot;&gt;recreating lost urban spaces such as the Soweto township under apartheid regimes&lt;/a&gt; (team led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/angeldnieves&quot;&gt;Angel David Nieves&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an event like the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;THATCamp unconferences&lt;/a&gt;, which started at George Mason University’s DH center (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chnm.gmu.edu/&quot;&gt;RRCHNM&lt;/a&gt;) and now take place around the world. These are events that try to bring DHers together to talk and build in less hierarchical ways than traditional humanities conferences do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a bot, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wcaleb&quot;&gt;Caleb McDaniel&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/every3minutes&quot;&gt;@Every3Minutes Twitter bot&lt;/a&gt;, which uses social media to hammer in the crushing regularity with which enslaved people were sold in antebellum America.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a tool for doing DH work, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chnm.gmu.edu/&quot;&gt;Center for History and New Media&lt;/a&gt;’s work developing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://omeka.org/&quot;&gt;Omeka platform&lt;/a&gt; for online museum and archival collections. Note that making Omeka is &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; DH work: the scholarship that consisted of thinking through, designing, and building Omeka (research assistant professor and Omeka developer Patrick Murray-John discusses this work &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/theory-digital-humanities-and-noticing-by-patrick-murray-john/&quot;&gt;in this Journal of DH piece&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using a script or a program to analyze text and discover who most likely authored it, and then publishing about your research (digitally or not). The 1962 Mosteller and Wallace analyses that went into determining the disputed authorship of the Federalist Papers were computer-based. (If this approach interests you, see the free online &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&amp;amp;chunk.id=ss1-4-1&amp;amp;toc.depth=1&amp;amp;toc.id=ss1-4-1&amp;amp;brand=default&quot;&gt;Blackwell Companion to DH and its chapter on stylistic analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Hugh Craig.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DH can look at huge historical events, or it can look at large events alongside the every day, as with projects in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackpressresearchcollective.org/&quot;&gt;the Black Press Research Collective&lt;/a&gt; (a team project founded and directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blackdigitalhum&quot;&gt;Kim Gallon&lt;/a&gt;). The Collective includes work includes mapping and visualizing the historical availability of black newspapers, so that we don’t only know what was being written, but can also conjecture on who had access to reading that writing. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattdelmont&quot;&gt;Matthew Delmont&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackquotidian.com/anvc/black-quotidian/introduction?path=index&quot;&gt;Black Quotidian&lt;/a&gt; captures moments of everyday black life from the past via historical newspapers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…meta-work around the digital humanities field, as with &lt;a href=&quot;http://transformdh.org/&quot;&gt;Transform DH&lt;/a&gt;’s work toward a more diverse and inclusive DH. TransformDH is a decentralized network that includes work by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/moyazb&quot;&gt;Moya Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fiona_barnett&quot;&gt;Fiona Barnett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anitaconchita&quot;&gt;Anne Cong-Huyen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alothian&quot;&gt;Alexis Lothian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NazcaTheMad&quot;&gt;Amanda Phillips&lt;/a&gt; among others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…the design of a platform like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mukurtu.org/&quot;&gt;Mukurtu&lt;/a&gt;, which is a CMS (website platform) like Drupal or Omeka, but is explicitly built to ethically support indigenous communities in managing their cultural heritage. Mukurtu was started by members of the Warumungu community, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mukurtu&quot;&gt;Kim Christen Withey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/craigdietrich&quot;&gt;Craig Dietrich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe you use traditional non-digital methods to do and print your humanities scholarship (as much as this Microsoft Word-loving field can be non-digital), but you’re plugged into DH Twitter and find out about the latest projects, new blogged thinking, and future collaborators by being part of a digital community (for what it’s worth, that seems to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to mean that you’re doing some of your scholarship digitally). DH can mean that you actively use digital means to take part in your intellectual community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DH can look like many kinds of methods and/or publication forms, and those methods should be inclusive of all kinds of critical thinking and contributions to shared knowledge—things that don’t always get credited as scholarship but should be, like coding, teaching, cleaning your data, building bibliographies, and documentation of how to use a humanities tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Edit: Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ProfessMoravec/&quot;&gt;Michelle Moravec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/digiwonk&quot;&gt;Aimée Morrison&lt;/a&gt; for their #inclusivesyllabi tweets and work, which encouraged me to try to define DH with a diverse list of examples. Ways I can improve the list before my next talk: check if authorship %s are good, and include teaching, community &amp;amp; outside-university work, student work, &amp;amp; LGBTQ examples. I’m keeping of things I need to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/digitalhumanities/issues/7&quot;&gt;here in a GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/digitalhumanities/blob/master/DiverseDHExampleList.md&quot;&gt;updating the list as on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; so I can easily compare it to past versions as it changes over time). Suggestions for authors and representations of DH my list is missing warmly welcomed! [Note that I’m not looking for more &lt;u&gt;general&lt;/u&gt; intro to DH resources, just examples of diverse DH work that I’ve failed to represent with my list.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current suggestions from DHers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elotroalex/status/756865619757260800&quot;&gt;examples of minimal computing aka #mincomp&lt;/a&gt;, plus &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dh-notes/dhnotes&quot;&gt;a larger list of DH places to read/write/go/etc.&lt;/a&gt; both via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elotroalex&quot;&gt;Alex Gil&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-isnt-dh&quot;&gt;What isn’t DH?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all this can be DH, maybe we want to say, &lt;em&gt;fine, what isn’t DH&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that question difficult to answer concisely or usefully? But I’ll try to give an example of a thing that can both very much “be” DH, or can be a non-DH thing—with explicit emphasis that &lt;strong&gt;it’s up to the practitioner(s) in question to identify whether they, their project, and their methods “are DH”.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;I added some stuff here subsequent to my talk, as I wasn’t quite sure I’d gotten across what I wanted to say and needed to think through it more via writing; you can &lt;a href=&quot;#dh-values&quot;&gt;skip down to the “DH values” section&lt;/a&gt; if you’d prefer.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite arguments that the term DH isn’t useful if we don’t define it more rigidly than I have above—and maybe what I’ve said above, or any of the other 800+ definitions, should really be enough as a definition?–I just don’t have much use for someone declaring whether &lt;em&gt;someone else’s&lt;/em&gt; work “is DH” or not, and have trouble imagining I wouldn’t find such a declaration both wrong and disrespectful. But there are reasons to apply the term DH other than boundary-defining: sometimes we want to talk about some group of work in general, or about work for which we don’t know whether the creator would term it DH, or want to say “I’d consider this project DH [implicitly expecting that anyone involved contradicted this, they have the last word]”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I define DH in part by a willingness to partner with and borrow from all other fields. If someone expresses interest in what a community is doing and its values, they don’t need to perfectly perform all those values to have some magical judge grant them entrance to an academic field. If we all had to tirelessly adhere to rules all the time or be cast out of DH, we wouldn’t have anyone in the field, and the field would never grow. (This is, of course, a separate issue from banning people from a community who are harassers or engage in other unethical behavior.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll give an example of a DH activity that is at some times somewhat related or overlapping with DH, and at some times not DH: digitization. (I really could have picked any of a number of activities: for example, it’s pretty clear to everyone that coding can “be” DH, or it can be not DH, e.g. coding for business, science, etc.). I’m picking digitization because the general public tends to be more aware of projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt;, of scanning and putting stuff online, and less aware of research based on it (Google Books might not be the best example because of DHers’ mixed response to  &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/ngrams&quot;&gt;stuff subsequently built from the Google Books digitization&lt;/a&gt;). The public tends to know less about other DHy things, and when I mention my field I sometimes encounter people thinking that “all” DH means is scanning and uploading humanities stuff. (One problem with this: you can “just” scan and upload in exactly the same way you can “just” write a shopping list or code a science tool, or you can engage critically with the decisions this involves, etc.). Digitization is a DH method, and is often crucial, scholarly work; it’s just that digitization (or coding, or whatever other method you want to think through) is in no way &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of what DH does. Just pointing to any method (scanning, 3D modeling, coding, writing…) without the thinking and sharing that together with that method equals scholarship, is something I do run into, and I want people to be aware of the thinking and learning part of using a scholarly method, too. (More on what “scholarly method” means to me later, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital humanities isn’t so much focused “just” on digitizing things. DH projects often don’t stop at scanning and putting humanities content like historical newspapers or photos online (although they could stop there and share their learning). Rather, DH projects often do so as a way to study or improve the process of digitization, or as a prelude to additional research. DH is often focused on designing inspiring and useful ways for interacting with those online materials, once they’ve been made digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;On reflection, I shouldn’t have picked digitization as my main example, because digitization work tends to be wrongly less treated as scholarly or more poorly paid, than other can-be-DH methods like coding. I think that incorrect dynamic made this explanation less concise than it could have been&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide19.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitization can be DH, just as much as coding, teaching, writing, performing, or many other possible methods of scholarship. Rather than bulk uploading of scanned documents, a DH digitization project might, for example, be concerned with figuring out the exact lighting and scanner settings to represent a scanned manuscript online, and the people doing this might speculate about what it would mean for a scan to be a more authoritative representation of the scanned manuscript, than if that manuscript were scanned with different lighting and settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These scholars are asking, how do we best represent this physical thing digitally? What would “best representation” mean, and is there even such a thing, or is any process that involves choices subjective? People aren’t just robotically scanning and uploading stuff; even if they’re overworked and underpaid they’re developing expertise around this technical work. People care about the work they do and can’t help but think critically about the best ways to do it, and it’s weird and not useful to assume people working in the humanities in any role aren’t expert critical thinkers around the work they do. One thing I like about DH is that the community tends to be a little better at recognizing all humanities labor as the scholarship it is (versus “traditional” humanities), rather than glossing over the important, critical thinking and scholarship of people in many different professional roles (&lt;em&gt;though it’s far from perfect at this recognition, as I’ll discuss below&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dh-values&quot;&gt;DH values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, asking if something is or isn’t DH might not be the most generative question (&lt;em&gt;I guess it generated a bunch of words from my keyboard, though…)&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, we may want to ask, what do DHers care about? And how can we encourage others to care about the same thing, when that’s appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll talk a bit more in-depth about three DH projects now, to give you a sense of what some DH values look like in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide20.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the trends I’m seeing in DH is a move from making things public, to making things participatory. 10-20 years ago, there was a big emphasis on just getting transcripts and scans of texts and images online, so people who couldn’t afford to travel to see the originals could nevertheless create scholarship around these things. These projects are great gifts to the world, and the critical thinking and decisions and experiments that went into them (and continues today with digitization staff) is DH scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a basic level of creating “access” to information, where someone’s scanned something and put it online where anyone can hypothetically access it. This is the case with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/fsa/&quot;&gt;the Library of Congress’ digitization and hosting&lt;/a&gt; of the thousands of photographs taken as part of government-sponsored programs during the Great Depression and WWII. These photos have been freely available online thanks to the LOC for years, and they give a wonderful view of what daily life was like all over the U.S. during this time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the website is hard to use if you’re not used to working with research data collections every day—that is, if you’re not a researcher. And it doesn’t have tools or other design aimed explicitly at helping students and the public see why these photos are interesting and relevant to them. What the LOC staff have done (especially despite their past &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/americas-national-library-is-behind-the-digital-curve-a-new-report-finds/2015/03/31/fad54c3a-d3fd-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html&quot;&gt;problematic management&lt;/a&gt; and with limited resources) is truly amazing scholarship, so I want to emphasize that this is awesome work, and I believe we need projects aimed just at researchers just like this project is—it’s just that I want researchers to be making more things that are aimed at people besides ourselves, also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Below is a 50-second clip I made checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/&quot;&gt;Photogrammar project&lt;/a&gt;… although since this is a blog post rather than a live presentation, I highly encourage &lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/&quot;&gt;just playing around with Photogrammar yourself&lt;/a&gt;! It’s extremely intuitive and impressive.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/175695252?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;434&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/&quot;&gt;The Photogrammar project&lt;/a&gt; at Yale, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/about/team/&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laura_wexler&quot;&gt;Laura Wexler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nolauren&quot;&gt;Lauren Tilton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/statsmaths&quot;&gt;Taylor Arnold&lt;/a&gt;, is a great example of what digital humanities projects can add to the basic access allowed by digitized materials. Photogrammar is built on those thousands of Great Depression and WWII photos hosted by the Library of Congress (&lt;a href=&quot;http://photogrammar.yale.edu/about/fsa_owi/&quot;&gt;the FSA-OWI collection, 1935-1944 photos sponsored by the Farm Security Administration&lt;/a&gt;). What Photogrammar does, is to add an appealing interface that makes you interested in looking at these photos, then supports you as you start to have questions you’d like to answer about the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide22.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional tools on the site help you locate the photos that would be most interesting to you, and relate to what you’re teaching or learning. For example, above is a tool that uses facial recognition to identify people in these photos, and to let you explore and question where and when these photos were taken by the subjects’ ethnicities. Another tool lets you find commonalities and differences among subsets of the photos: like what kind of photos were most often taken in California between 1935 and 1945?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the LOC ‘s project as representative of an earlier but still extremely important set of DH values: of getting stuff online in clean and accessible fashion; once more information is online, we can start to make it easier for people to do stuff with it, like Photogrammar does. Photogrammar is representative of a more recent value of DH: making the humanities not just more public, but more publicly inviting and participatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide23.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docnow.io/&quot;&gt;Documenting the Now&lt;/a&gt; is a DH project building ethical tools for preserving and including social media activism in the archive, with a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatter&quot;&gt;#BlackLivesMatter&lt;/a&gt; and related hashtags. More than just a tool, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docnow.io/&quot;&gt;DocNow&lt;/a&gt; is building a community around the difficult questions of ethically and respectfully creating a historical record of protests, including through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wk0JdF2Cty2VHMqpf_QlJXVKQdUtfeeFhaYRben3qaM/viewform&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; (a chat platform) where everyone is invited to participate in conversations around archival ethics and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DocNow’s community lead, archivist &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BergisJules&quot;&gt;Bergis Jules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BergisJules/status/755484124614303744&quot;&gt;describes the project&lt;/a&gt; as trying to make the social media and web archiving conversation and work more inclusive, and says &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; might be the most important contribution of their project, even more than the tool they create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DocNow’s lead developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edsu&quot;&gt;Ed Summers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.docnow.io/docnow-as-community-2aa13fca860f#.gtbx9a4jh&quot;&gt;describes their work&lt;/a&gt; by saying: “I think what we are hoping to do is build a tool that doesn’t just do things because it’s possible, but has some values built into it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a couple things I like about DH, and optimistically think of as representative of DH’s values: they’re documenting their thinking and decisions, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.docnow.io/&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wk0JdF2Cty2VHMqpf_QlJXVKQdUtfeeFhaYRben3qaM/viewform&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, as they go along. They’re thinking about the shortcomings of technology: what happens to discussions happening on for-profit platforms like Twitter, where video links can break, tweets can be taken out of context, and people converse without consenting to becoming part of some institution’s record? They’re thinking carefully about the ethics of what they build and what others may do with what they build, trying to be not just legal, but moral. They’ve created &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wk0JdF2Cty2VHMqpf_QlJXVKQdUtfeeFhaYRben3qaM/viewform&quot;&gt;a community space&lt;/a&gt; where anyone interested in these questions can participate in the conversation shaping the tool. And they’re working toward making the archive a better, more diverse, actively anti-racist record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide24.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final example, one of my DH projects is a website that supports collaboratively reading and interpreting a really difficult novel, James Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses.&lt;/em&gt; Above is a screenshot of the front page of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses digital edition&lt;/a&gt;. The images give a high level tour of the edition’s features: you can highlight parts of the book and annotate those highlights; read others’ annotations; and start to personalize what annotations you see to your background, interests, and needs on a very basic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project was to take a popular DH platform—the scholarly digital edition—and look at ways we can use visual and community design to invite, welcome, support, and value the contributions of non-academics in the conversations around challenging and complex literary texts. It was an experiment—I wasn’t sure what was going to happen and whether anyone would use the site. I also valued publicly documenting the design and technical choices I made throughout the project, and to not only discuss successes but also failures, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/05/12/spring-2014-tech-update&quot;&gt;the time I spent 6 months working with a platform I ended up not using in the final website&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&quot;&gt;a blog post twice a month&lt;/a&gt; to capture this information where others could read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide25.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing access can mean reaching out farther to collaborate with audiences that aren’t as welcomed by the humanities. We want to think about the time and money required to engage with DH projects; about the bandwidth and hardware needed; about who gets to see themselves represented and spoken to. One of the failures I often hear ascribed to MOOCs, is that they don’t actually open up learning to people who didn’t already have some other option in terms of accessing higher ed resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As happy as I am with how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; has reached a variety of readers outside academia, of all ages and from around the world, there are two big things I’d like the project to do better. The first is to design to invite and support readers who don’t already have other alternatives for making their way through Joyce. And the second goal is to make this bigger than &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;: I was able to draw over 20 thousand site unique visitors because people have heard something about James Joyce and &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s a big problem if what we create and encourage people to visit online just recreates the canon of print books (and a related problem that huge numbers of site visitors doesn’t mean people who stay and enjoy the project). As much as I like &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, I want to figure out what readers on my site like about the novel, and then point them to less-canon texts that do similar things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide26.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I talk about why you might want to be involved in the digital humanities, I tend to speak toward the good and ideal of DH, and the DH I want to see. But DH isn’t some magical anomaly. It’s a community of people from a lot of fields, with a lot of subfields of its own, and it shares many of the same problems as humanities fields, something the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23transformdh&quot;&gt;#TransformDH hashtag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://transformdh.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; are working on. I encourage you to check out the Twitter hashtags on the screen for some useful conversations around problems in DH, including issues at the yearly big DH conference that took place last week—the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/arc.html?key=1zlUFubccXY7Pekfs0bXgxzIbNalJPGvU_SJIlmLTI50&amp;amp;gid=400689247&quot;&gt;#DHdiversity hashtag&lt;/a&gt; (archive captured by &lt;a href=&quot;https://epriego.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/dhdiversity-a-searchable-archive-and-a-quick-comment-from-afar/&quot;&gt;Ernesto Priego&lt;/a&gt;) documents a series of panels and talks identifying ongoing issues of sexism, racism, ableism, and other marginalizations in DH and at our conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are marginalized and in precarious professional roles are still overly called to testify and labor for improvements within DH. And DH is getting big: the yearly DH conference last week drew 902 participants from 45 countries, but diverse representation is lagging behind the realities of who does DH. Projects actively working to make DH better in this regard include &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/roopikarisam&quot;&gt;Roopika Risam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michacardenas&quot;&gt;micha cárdenas&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://criticaldh.roopikarisam.com/&quot;&gt;Social Justice and DH project&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elotroalex&quot;&gt;Alex Gil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryancordell&quot;&gt;Ryan Cordell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arounddh.org/credits/&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arounddh.org/&quot;&gt;Around DH in 80 Days&lt;/a&gt; (which highlights DH centers and projects from around the world); and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/&quot;&gt;Off the Tracks Collaborators’ Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdh.ucla.edu/news-events/a-student-collaborators-bill-of-rights/&quot;&gt;UCLA A Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt; (which both lay out how to ethically credit and celebrate the labor of everyone involved in a DH project).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide27.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I like to work toward what I want my DH to be, I don’t want to give anyone the impression that DH is some utopia. It’s not better than other fields, but it has in its favor some more ways for people to regularly, actively move the field to be a little bit better at a time. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/mydhis&quot;&gt;#MyDHis hashtag&lt;/a&gt; captures people speaking about their visions for what DH should value; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/whatifdh2017&quot;&gt;#WhatIfDH2017&lt;/a&gt; and previous years’ hashtags capture suggestions and provocations challenging the next year’s big DH conference to be better than this year’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to express some of the things that &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; DH is. I tend to see DH as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valuing interdisciplinarity (including of methods)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A celebration and valuing of a variety of skills and professional roles&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As real-time: I love being part of a community where I can ask a question on Twitter or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;DH Slack&lt;/a&gt; and hear a bunch of ideas in the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As valuing sharing what you learn, without needing to be an expert: I was able to get started doing some very basic information visualization work and &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/gephi/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; about what I did. Even without being anything ever near an expert in information visualization, I’ve heard from people who were also able to get started in infoviz by reading my blog posts. (If you’re interested in information visualization and analysis, one place to start is Miriam Posner’s blog (&lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/#network&quot;&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/the-case-of-the-missing-faces/&quot;&gt;infoviz and ethics for historical research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/a-fun-way-to-introduce-dh-students-to-dataviz/&quot;&gt;infoviz lesson plan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/getting-started-with-palladio/&quot;&gt;Palladio tool&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/scott_bot&quot;&gt;Scott Weingart&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/index.html@p=39600.html&quot;&gt;when networks are inappropriate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;On review: wow, there’s a lot of other things #myDHis not in this list, but I think they’re represented by the projects I chose to cite in this talk: public and participatory, diverse and inclusive and anti-racist, ethical and respectful… hoping to update my old “DH values” post soon to better hold myself to perform these values in my work.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide28.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&quot;&gt;a very DHy dissertation&lt;/a&gt; that didn’t have any chapter writing; instead, I was able to spend some time thinking through the best methods and publication formats for pursuing my research question and sharing what I learned. It turned out that designing, coding, blogging, and user-testing what I’d built were the best ways for my research to go. Being linked into the DH community was a big part of successfully being able to do that as my dissertation, instead of doing one traditional dissertation, and a whole extra DH project that wasn’t officially counted. The DH I’ve encountered is open to rethinking how what we value as scholars can look, given today’s knowledge and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to see people not feeling enfranchised to call themselves digital humanists, not feeling enfranchised to call themselves scholars, not feeling enfranchised to call all their critical efforts research. So I tend to emphasize these labels to counteract imposter syndrome, people being undercredited, people not getting opportunities to situate their work as intellectual labor.
I also want to recognize that there are negative results of this habit: not everyone is or wants to be called a digital humanist or a scholar or a researcher, so I absolutely do not want to say someone is any of these things, if that’s not how someone identifies themself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide29.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;twitter.com/moyazb&quot;&gt;Moya Bailey&lt;/a&gt; at Northeastern recently gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.culturalfront.org/2016/07/reflections-on-space-place-in.html&quot;&gt;a great talk here&lt;/a&gt; discussing the pros and cons of strategically leveraging the phrase “digital humanities”, and I’d encourage you all to &lt;a href=&quot;http://moyabailey.com/projects/dh/&quot;&gt;check out her work&lt;/a&gt;. She emphasized that choosing to label yourself or your work via DH can open opportunities for funding and publicity and community, but identifying with DH can also close doors or make others expect certain things about your work, or turn away scholars who are not interested in or are resistant to digital scholarship. So maybe what you do, or want to do, or the community you want to join or create, isn’t DH: you can still make use of DH-labeled resources, but choose to identify yourself and your work in a variety of ways, and attend a plethora of DHy conferences beyond the main huge DH event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide30.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage people starting with DH—especially students looking to take on a DH project but also complete their coursework or dissertation—to remember that prototyping is an option. That is, you can have a research question and imagine an ideal digital method or tool or presentation format to pursue that research. To then document the critical thinking that went into your brainstorming design, to list problems you foresee or storyboard how someone might engage with your idea, to get out your colored pencils and sketch your tool, or use some other way of wireframing or prototyping what you’re imagining—and then share all that with your community, is scholarship. It absolutely contributes to communal knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t some magical requirement that you go on and code the idea yourself, though you certainly can embark on learning how to do that—having a specific project in mind does wonders for making tutorials stick in your brain. And learning about cod,e or other pieces of realizing a DH project, helps you understand issues, limitations, opportunities you might not have seen otherwise. Or, understand why DH has treated some opportunities as low-hanging fruit and others as blue-sky wishes. But you can also leave that scholarship to a collaborator—coding and building are useful methods, but they are just some of many methods out there, and nobody needs to take all of them on. Many DH projects are necessarily collaborative, because they require many skills and no one person is likely to offer expertise for each. You can work in DH without needing to do everything yourself, and without being an expert in coding or a digital method; maybe your contribution is historical knowledge, or being great at locating information online, or designing, documenting, user testing, or publicizing, among many other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide31.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samplereality&quot;&gt;Mark Sample&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samplereality.com/2013/02/08/when-does-service-become-scholarship/&quot;&gt;a fantastic blog essay on the question: “When does service become scholarship?”&lt;/a&gt;, in which he says his answer to that question “is simply this: a creative or intellectual act becomes scholarship when it is public and circulates in a community of peers that evaluates and builds upon it.” One of the things I like most about DH, is that practitioners tend to recognize and reward scholarship in its many methods and forms. Scholarship isn’t bounded by what your professional title is or whether you create something that looks like a book or journal article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see DH as not just about openness to many methods as ways to think critically and share those thoughts, but also as a movement to recognize meta-activities such as project management and documentation as scholarship. So my biggest reason why DH can be good for you, for your department or unit or university, is that it usually comes with a culture of valuing all kinds of effort. I do want to recognize that some people don’t want to identify as scholars or their work as scholarly; when I speak of scholars here, I mean everyone who’s interested in doing their best thinking and sharing the results of that thinking with others, whether you’re teaching, developing a library unit workflow, coding, writing, or another method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, it can make a useful difference in how you feel about your job and your work, if you start to value all of your effort as part of being a scholar, or feel enfranchised to identify as a scholar or researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying with DH opens up an interdisciplinary community that, while in &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; perfect, is at least sometimes better than traditional academic departments at a couple useful things—and when it fails, we at least more often have public discussions about that failure, and these at least more often can slowly improve our community (e.g. when the big DH conference had all-female keynote speakers this year, and the #DHdiversity hashtag was used extensively to identify ongoing problems and suggest improvements). DH tends to welcome newcomers a little more, in part because it’s the norm for someone with years of experience in some academic field to be new to a digital method, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DH tends to value all kinds of professional roles and to think about how to make collaboration and attribution and credit work well, because the skills we need to make solid projects incorporate all kinds of design, theoretical, practical, technical, archival thinking (and when I say theoretical, I guess I should point out that a big thing in DH is recognizing that it isn’t just article and book writing that gets to be called “theory”; that all methods of research, for example coding and digital platform design, engage in existing theory and develop their own theories as well). Being part of this community means you can use platforms like Twitter and Slack to get real-time feedback on your thinking and projects, and sometimes you’re able to focus on and reach much wider audiences than traditional scholarship allows. (Twitter isn’t any safer for being a DHer, but on the DH Slack I’m trying to hold discussions to a code of conduct as far as a couple casual moderators can for 700 people.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHers use the term “alt-ac” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23altac&quot;&gt;#altac&lt;/a&gt;) to refer to “alternative academic” positions, which are career paths that satisfy your desire to work as a scholar while recognizing that tenure-track teaching positions are extremely limited in number, and that many excellent researchers who would like to have such a position just can’t, in terms of position availability. There’s some really good blogging about DHer alt-ac experiences, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/&quot;&gt;the #alt-academy mediacommons project&lt;/a&gt;. It might not seem like a big deal to be aware of related types of job if you’re coming from interdisciplinary library science, but often humanities PhDs come out of their dissertations without being aware of career options other than tenure-track teaching. Besides the obvious digital skills involvement in DH can help you develop, related abilities like being able to work well with a team of people with different interests and backgrounds, and having experience in project design, management, and grant-writing, are all skills DH projects can model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the university level, DH’s emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, methodologies over content, and recognition that all academic fields deal with history of the field, ethics, subjective interpretation, design, and texts will help us connect libraries and liberal arts units to other campus communities including STEM departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide34.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll finish up with some resources for getting started in DH. I’ll talk briefly about where to ask questions and find foundational resources online, where to publish and read current DH work, doing DH as a job, and arguing about DH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide35.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a combination of things you can do to get involved in DH, either where you are (depending on local resources) or online. Does your library have a DH, digital scholarship, or other “digital something” librarian or unit—someone who doesn’t also happen to be you? If not, I’d still recommend asking around if your colleagues have consulted or collaborated with anyone on campus doing DH. Student and staff working groups and book clubs are another option—if there aren’t any where you are, you might use a campus listserv and put out a call for anyone interested in meeting to chat and work through reading a solid DH resource such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/&quot;&gt;Debates in the Digital Humanities series&lt;/a&gt; (which is free online, and offers timely argumentative pieces about the shape and future of DH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen some people come at DH by taking a term they keep hearing—say, Drupal websites—and deciding to learn that thing. Having that focus can work well, but I find you’re more likely to be successful if you get a little help at the start in choosing a tool or method that’s actually the best fit for your interests (Drupal, for example, can do cool things but is a headache to maintain, so you only want to use it when you need features other options don’t offer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can find someone in-person or online who’s involved in DH, ask if they’d be willing to point you in the right direction given your interests, whether that’s a specific research question or imagined project, or just the desire to learn how digital methods could support your love of Victorian dime novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to ask strangers online for help, and I know people involved in scholarly organizations who are thinking through making virtual mentoring a good option. In the meantime, safer places to ask for direction or advice include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/&quot;&gt;DH Q&amp;amp;A forum&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHSlack&quot;&gt;DH Slack&lt;/a&gt; (which is like a set of DH themed chatrooms, with currently over 700 members and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amandavisconti/DHslack/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md&quot;&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/DHslack&quot;&gt;DH Slack&lt;/a&gt; has a number of channels (or themed chatrooms) for asking any level of DH question, for students wanting to discuss fitting DH into their studies, for self-identified beginners, and for people interested in seeing the kinds of jobs and conferences currently available in DH. I run the Slack, so if you’re curious about joining or participating, but have questions or would like suggestions for getting involved, please feel free to tweet at me (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/literature_geek&quot;&gt;@Literature_Geek&lt;/a&gt;) or send me an email (viscount@purdue.edu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide36.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a project idea that needs funding, DH funders including &lt;a href=&quot;https://mellon.org/grants/&quot;&gt;Mellon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neh.gov/&quot;&gt;NEH&lt;/a&gt; (National Endowment for the Humanities and especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh&quot;&gt;the NEH Office of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imls.gov/&quot;&gt;IMLS&lt;/a&gt; (Institute of Museum and Library Services) often post example grant proposals or successful past proposals, which can be useful in shaping your research or discovering precedents in a subfield, even if you’re not applying for a grant yourself. If you are interested in grant funding, though, you should know that some regular DH funders—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh&quot;&gt;the NEH Office of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt; definitely, and I believe also the IMLS?—have amazing program officers willing to read through and comment on your grant proposal, if you ask for feedback before the actual grant submission deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide37.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the good places to read about and publish in DH &lt;em&gt;(note: resources linked in this section are very much non-exhaustive as there are lots more places to read/share/do DH, but this blog represents a time-limited talk rather than an exhaustive resource—see &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/mswEpAIS9K&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for more stuff!):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/&quot;&gt;DH Now&lt;/a&gt; is an aggregator of DH online content; I use it to hear about new blog posts on DH topics, but it also aggregates DH events, CFPs, and job openings. You can follow via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhnow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or RSS feed. But DH now isn’t just a good way to hear about DH, it’s a good place to get started in DH social media. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/editors-corner/volunteer/&quot;&gt;volunteer as an editor of DH Now&lt;/a&gt;, which means that during a specific week you’ll curate a feed of incoming content from &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/subscribed-feeds/&quot;&gt;a huge set of DH blogs and websites&lt;/a&gt;, and recommend the best stuff for sharing. This is a great way to get an overview of who you might want to follow on Twitter or who’s doing work related to your interests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another option is &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/&quot;&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt; website (&lt;em&gt;I should note that I’ve just joined the site’s editorial team last week because I like the project so much—so I’m biased, but for a good reason&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt; offers peer-reviewed, novice-friendly lessons on DH tools and methods; it’s not only pitched at the right place for someone who wants to learn a skill but doesn’t already know other digital methods; each lesson tries to explain why a humanities researcher might want to use the tool, and how. In addition to being a good place for learning, it’s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/contribute&quot;&gt;a place to do peer-reviewed publication of DH lessons and tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. If you need peer-reviewed pieces for promotion or tenure in your job, this can be a way to get credit for skills you already know, while at the same time mentoring others you want to learn those skills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcommons.org/&quot;&gt;DH Commons&lt;/a&gt; is both a platform for sharing DH projects and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcommons.org/collaborators&quot;&gt;volunteering as a collaborator&lt;/a&gt; for things like beta-testing new DH work, and also &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcommons.org/journal&quot;&gt;an online, peer-reviewed journal&lt;/a&gt;. This journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://dhcommons.org/journal/submission-guidelines&quot;&gt;supports submitting peer-reviewed publications&lt;/a&gt; of two DHy types: you can submit DH project statements (explanations of the work that went into your DH research) and you can submit  “How did they make that?” pieces (explaining the tech/design/methods that went into making what you made, based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miriamkp&quot;&gt;Miriam Posner&lt;/a&gt;’s highly recommended &lt;a href=&quot;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/&quot;&gt;blog post of the same title&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other journals friendly to DH publication (and free to read online!) include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies&quot;&gt;Digital Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/&quot;&gt;The Journal of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt; (on hiatus, but past articles are interesting to read)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vectorsjournal.org/&quot;&gt;Vectors&lt;/a&gt;, a journal for publishing multimedia work in DH and related areas. I believe they take all kinds of DH pieces (websites, visualizations, etc.) but may have a preference for things authored using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/&quot;&gt;Scalar&lt;/a&gt; tool?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/resources/digital-humanities-journals&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities at Berkeley’s great overview of these and other DH publications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not interested in a DH job yourself, keeping abreast of recent DH job ads can give you a better sense of how different DH subfields and tools cluster—you’ll see what kinds of tools DH archivists are using, what history professors are using, and be better able to point others in the right direction for getting involved in DH. And if you are thinking about a DH career, being aware of the language in DH job ads can help you tailor your learning toward a specific role.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Using general job search engines like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usajobs.gov&quot;&gt;USA Jobs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Digital-humanities&quot;&gt;Indeed.com with “digital humanities” as the search term&lt;/a&gt; is more hit and miss, but you can set things up so they email you whenever a job matching DH appears on their sites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re interested in government DHy jobs (e.g. NEH ODH, IMLS, Smithsonian…), besides searching by institution on the USA Jobs site, you can follow NEH ODH Senior Program Officer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jenserventi&quot;&gt;Jennifer Serventi&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, where she periodically shares these humanities-focused jobs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JenServenti/status/755926991388315648&quot;&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start to see a lot of projects that fit your interest coming from one DH center or department, it can’t hurt to follow their website’s RSS feed to hear about new job openings. And when you apply, remember that DH gives you particular skills beyond technical ones, and you should demonstrate these skills to potential employers: the ability to handle project management (even more, often for projects with less precedents than usual precedents in academia!), experience with collaboration and interdisciplinarity, and learning to communicate in voices suited to multiple audiences and with relevancy for who you’re talking to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DH_DLFtalk/Slide39.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I wanted to say a bit about arguing to do DH. If you run into trouble with someone preventing you from doing DH work (e.g. saying you can’t use your professional development funding to learn a DH tool, or that you can’t satisfy coursework with digital scholarship), you can help you argument in a couple ways. You might develop a concise statement or elevator pitch, using no specialist/technical language: maybe one paragraph on what your final deliverables will look like (to help people picture what you’ll do), and one paragraph explaining why your digital methods or format are the best way for exploring and communicating your research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also help to assemble a list of precedents for your work. When I was arguing that I should be able to design and code a digital edition for my dissertation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2013/08/19/scholarlyexperimentation&quot;&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2013/06/26/experimental-editions&quot;&gt;pointed to&lt;/a&gt; work by established scholars like Alan Galey, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/index.html&quot;&gt;Visualizing Variation&lt;/a&gt; project uses code to make arguments about early modern textual scholarship. I also looked for examples both of similar methods and formats; in my case, my committee pointed out that literature departments have a history of allowing a print scholarly edition as a dissertation. I also looked to pre-digital precedents in my subfield: textual scholarship—the people who create scholarly editions of texts—has a long history of using design and building to perform arguments (e.g. the Victorian editor Teena Rochfort Smith created &lt;a href=&quot;http://literaturegeek.com/2013/06/26/experimental-editions&quot;&gt;an experimental prototype of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with typography so innovative it would have been impossible to print at scale at that time). A lot of the rejection of digital scholarship hinges on it being “different” from non-digital scholarship, so showing the ways digital scholarship is a natural successor to research widely recognized as scholarship is a useful tactic (not “digital vs. traditional”, but “digital vs. non-digital”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I hope I communicated earlier, DH is not perfect. DH has a lot of areas where we can greatly improve as a community. That said, I don’t want to overemphasize the issue of needing to argue for DH as scholarship. Instead of predicting that my DH work will meet with resistance, I try to design my work to invite understanding, by doing things like showing its continuity with past non-digital work, and making sure I’m careful about defining technical terms. From just my particular point of view, I can say that presenting DH pedagogically rather than defensively has been great at helping me communicate with people not involved in DH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you to organizers Jason Clark, Oliver Bendorf, and Sara Mannheimer, as well as to the DLF eResearch Network members for being a great audience! Also, a big thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elikaortega&quot;&gt;Élika Ortega&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StewartVarner&quot;&gt;Stewart Varner&lt;/a&gt; (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://stewartvarner.com/2016/01/what-dh-could-be/&quot;&gt;What DH Could Be&lt;/a&gt;”) for changing how I present on and define DH. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/arc.html?key=1zlUFubccXY7Pekfs0bXgxzIbNalJPGvU_SJIlmLTI50&amp;amp;gid=400689247&quot;&gt;#DHdiversity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/mydhis&quot;&gt;#MyDHis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/whatifdh2017&quot;&gt;#WhatIfDH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://transformdh.org/&quot;&gt;#TransformDH&lt;/a&gt; DHers are also awesome and have helped me be a better DHer and person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. I can’t find the original creator of the GIF on my first slide (museum gallery with framed loading icons). Let me know if you know—I’d like to credit them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Infinite Ulysses in the New York Times and other recent DH activity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of DH stuff cooking lately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteulysses.com&quot;&gt;Infinite Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; project was mentioned and linked in the &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;! The piece, by J.D. Biersdorfer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/books/review/cant-get-through-ulysses-digital-help-is-on-the-way.html&quot;&gt;appeared online July 13, 2016 as “Can’t Get Through ‘Ulysses’? Digital Help Is on the Way”&lt;/a&gt; and in print on Sunday, July 17, 2016 in the “Sunday Book Review” section of the paper under the headline “Virtual Odyssey”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; editorial team as an editor and also ombudsperson. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an online, peer-reviewed, novice-friendly platform for humanities scholars wishing to learn digital methods and tools. (You might remember I published a lesson, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages&quot;&gt;Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;”, with &lt;em&gt;PH&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be presenting to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diglib.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Library Federation&lt;/a&gt; (DLF) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diglib.org/groups/e-research-network/&quot;&gt;eResearch Network&lt;/a&gt; as their DH speaker in a six-talk series on digital library research and data management practice, on July 20th. I’ll cover what digital humanities is, why it can be good for you and your institution, and how to get started in DH. The slides and talk video should go online shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DH 2016 conference just finished up (check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/arc.html?key=1zlUFubccXY7Pekfs0bXgxzIbNalJPGvU_SJIlmLTI50&amp;amp;gid=400689247&quot;&gt;the #DHdiversity tweets&lt;/a&gt; especially), so incoming new ACH executive officers Scott Weingart, Micki Kaufman, and I have begun our 2016-2020 terms, along with Jen Guiliano as the new ACH president 2016-2018 and Matt Gold as the new vice-president 2016-2018 and 2018-2020.&lt;/p&gt;
