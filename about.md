# Hey, there! This is Amanda Visconti's blog.

# I'm a digital humanist web developer: I love the challenge of designing &amp; building interfaces for the future of digital reading, and I'm using my backgrounds in design, information studies, and the humanities to make my development innovative, audience-focused, and accessible.

## This Site

I write here regularly about my niches of thoughtful coding &amp; the digital humanities (DH): code, design, and user-testing towards better—_more public, more participatory, more fun, more beautiful_—websites and digital tools for preserving, sharing, and using our cultural heritage. Good places to begin are my posts giving [an overview of my dissertation](http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation/ "Digital Dissertation"), [tech details](http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/25/iufeatures/ "Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition") on my building of a participatory digital edition of _Ulysses_ (think Reddit + StackExchange+a really difficult book), and this post how I reify my [intellectual values](http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/12/02/valuespost/ "Values") in my work. Or, hop over to my [Projects &amp; Experiments page](http://www.literaturegeek.com/projects/ "Project &amp; Experiment Links") to look at some of the sites and projects I've recently built!

## My Background: Academic Version

I hold **a M.S. in Information with a specialization in Digital Humanities Human-Computer Interaction** from the University of Michigan School of Information, where I studied the usability of digital humanities archives and digital editions for public (non-scholar) audiences.

I'm currently a **Ph.D. candidate** finishing up a **non-monograph, design/code/usability/blogging literature dissertation** for the University of Maryland English Department; read more about my work toward making the humanities more public (while exploring some exciting info science and design questions at the same time!) [here](http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation/ "Digital Dissertation").

Complementing my digital humanities studies, I've worked in various capacities at the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu) (MITH)** digital humanities think-tank** since 2009: IMLS Model Digital Humanities Intern, Webmaster, and as a graduate research assistant on the [BitCurator](http://www.BitCurator.net) digital forensics + born-digital collections project. [I'm currently the **Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow** in residence at MITH.](http://mith.umd.edu/mith-welcomes-amanda-visconti-as-winnemore-fellow/)

## My Background: Professional Version

As a web developer, designer, and digital humanist, I’m **a CMS geek** with over six years of webdev experience, especially skilled in work with three powerful systems: **WordPress, Drupal, and [Omeka](http://Omeka.org)**. I love a design challenge, and I love making my choices well-documented and understandable to my non-tech colleagues. Some example projects? I've recently worked:

*   writing PHP for part of the Wordpress plugin for the [Making Digital Humanities More Open](http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/braillesc) project, which will make CMS content (where much of digital humanities content–and really, much of all the content on the internet–resides) more accessible, starting by making Braille translation of web content simple
*   as the webmaster at [a prestigious digital humanities think-tank](http://mith.umd.edu), in charge of a diverse range of tasks from quickly spinning up Drupal, Wordpress, Omeka, and Mediawiki sites to thinking about the longterm preservation of our older project websites
*   wiki+screencast documentation creator and usability tester for the [BitCurator](http://www.bitcurator.net) suite of software (tools to help librarians and archivists apply digital forensics to born-digital collections)

## The Benefits of a Hybrid Background!

**I've worked in a variety of academic and information professional roles as well as frequently collaborated across the academy. **My focus on building DH tools, textual scholarship (the study of forms of communication old and new, from books to video game files), and information studies background exposed me to a wide variety of humanities and information projects, encompassing diverse areas in addition to literature and history such as the performing arts, computer science, archival practice, and both physical and digital preservation: an interdisciplinary, public humanities.

**I’ve collaborated with faculty, library and technical staff, and students on research projects across many disciplines** (e.g. on an NSF-funded, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, literary scholars, information professionals, and creative writers), and **I’ve also been in most of these roles myself at some point** (e.g. as an undergraduate teacher, web developer, graduate scholar, librarian, and archivist). This experience, together with wearing various hats at the highly interdisciplinary Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), formed me into a skilled connector and translator among diverse audiences and a skilled manager of digital and human resources across the lifespan of DH projects—so **I'm skilled at making my tech, library, and academic work translate well when conversing with people from different backgrounds than mine** (in fact, I feel that I don't really understand a thing unless I can explain it to a non-specialist!).
