<p>Hello! This is (Dr!) Amanda Visconti's research blog.</p>

<p>I've been <a href="http://www.AmandaVisconti.com">a professional web designer/developer and UX researcher</a> for 8+ years, including various roles 2009-2015 at the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> (MITH) digital humanities R&D center. I hold a new <a href="dr.AmandaVisconti.com">UMD Literature Ph.D.</a> (May 2015) and a University of Michigan <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380">Information M.S.</a> (Digital Humanities HCI) where I received the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/margaret-mann-award-recipients-1941-present">Margaret Mann Award</a> for demonstrated ability and promise of professional development.</p>

<p>My research focuses on making the digital humanities more participatory by designing and building for+with the public, and I look to non-academic digital communities (Reddit, StackExchange) and movements (citizen archivists, Twitter activism) for inspiration. </p>

<h2>Unique digital dissertation</h2>
<p>In Spring 2015, I successfully defended a <a href="dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities dissertation</a> with an innovative form and methodology: design, code, usertesting, blogging, and an analytic whitepaper at the very end. This dissertation was unique in not including a traditional proto-monograph (4-5 chapters of writing). For more information, check out my posts from during the dissertation or all posts with advice for digital humanities graduate students. Find the completed dissertation at <a href="dr.AmandaVisconti.com">Dr.AmandaVisconti.com</a>, including the whitepaper and the InfiniteUlysses.com site I created as the focus of the dissertation. Relatedly, my <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380">master's thesis</a> ran a formal user study of public users encountering scholarly DH interfaces, in order to recommend small design changes that could make such projects serve a wider audience.</p>
