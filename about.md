<p>Hello! This is (Dr!) Amanda Visconti's research blog.</p>

<p>I'm a digital humanities researcher as well as <a href="http://www.AmandaVisconti.com">a professional web designer/developer and UX researcher</a> with over eight years of experience, including various roles 2009-2015 at the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> (MITH) digital humanities R&D center. I recently successfully defended UMD <a href="dr.AmandaVisconti.com">Literature Ph.D.</a> using design, code, and usertesting to explore collaborative online reading (May 2015). I also hold a University of Michigan <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380">Information M.S.</a> (Digital Humanities HCI), receiving the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/margaret-mann-award-recipients-1941-present">Margaret Mann Award</a> for demonstrated ability and promise of professional development.</p>

<h2> Areas of interest/expertise</h2>
<p>I'm interested in a lot of things, including:
<ul>
<li>social reading/learning</li>
<li>web annotation</li>
<li>digital information filtering and personalization</li>
<li>HCI and building as research</li>
<li>digital preservation (including <a href="http://www.bitcurator.net/bitcurator/">via digital forensics tools</a>)</li>
<li>edition and archive interfaces</li>
<li>scholarly editing and digital edition design</li>
<li>user testing and usability work in the humanities</li>
<li>alternate reality games</li>
<li>James Joyce and <em>Ulysses</em>, Modernist novels, e-lit, comics, videogames, and other weird texts</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Infinite Ulysses</h2>
<p>My research makes the digital humanities more participatory by designing and building for+with the public. With my most recent project, the <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">InfiniteUlysses.com</a> digital edition/social reading platform, I looked to non-academic digital communities including Reddit and StackExchange to address community-authored text and personalization of displayed annotations. Infinite Ulysses invites readers of all backgrounds to come read and discuss James Joyce's challenging novel, supporting annotation (highlight text and add a question/answer, interpretation, definition, translation, etc.) and attempting to personalize what annotations are displayed to each reader's needs and interests.</p>

<h2>Unique digital dissertation</h2>
<p>In Spring 2015, I successfully defended a <a href="dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities dissertation</a> with an innovative form and methodology: design, <a href="https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-dissertation/">code</a>, usertesting, blogging, and an <a href="http://dissertation.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf">analytic whitepaper</a> during the final few weeks before the defense. This dissertation was unique in not employing the usual proto-monograph (written chapters). For more information, check out <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation">my posts from during the dissertation</a> or <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/tag/grad-advice">all posts with advice for digital humanities graduate students</a>. Find the completed dissertation at <a href="dr.AmandaVisconti.com">Dr.AmandaVisconti.com</a>, including the <a href="http://dissertation.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf">whitepaper</a> and the <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">InfiniteUlysses.com</a> digital edition/social reading platform I created as the focus of the dissertation. Relatedly, my <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380">master's thesis</a> ran a formal user study of public users encountering scholarly DH interfaces, in order to recommend small design changes that could make such projects serve a wider audience.</p>
