<p>Hello! This is (Dr!) Amanda Visconti's research blog.</p>

<p>Dr. Amanda Visconti designs, codes, and analyzes user and site data toward helping the humanities grow more open: not just publicly accessible, but inviting and supporting public participation. She is the Digital Humanities Specialist and an assistant professor in the Libraries at Purdue University.</p>

<p>An active maker and member of the digital humanities community, Visconti's <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">recently completed University of Maryland Literature Ph.D.</a> consisted of the design, code, and user-testing of an experimental social reading interface (InfiniteUlysses.com) instead of a proto-monograph. Visconti holds an <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380">Information M.S.</a> with a specialization in digital humanities HCI from the University of Michigan, where she worked with public humanities enthusiasts to identify small design changes that could open scholarly websites to public use, and received the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/margaret-mann-award-recipients-1941-present">Margaret Mann Award</a> for demonstrated ability and promise of professional development.</p>

<p>A professional digital humanities web developer and UX researcher for over eight years, Visconti has worked since 2009 in various roles at the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> (MITH), one of the world's top digital humanities R&D centers. She tweets @Literature_Geek, blogs her design research at LiteratureGeek.com, shares her code on GitHub (github.com/amandavisconti), and maintains a project portfolio at AmandaVisconti.com.

<h2> Areas of interest/expertise</h2>
<p>I'm interested in a lot of things, including:
<ul>
<li>building weird/experimental stuff for self-motivated learning</li>
<li>social reading and learning, especially in the digital humanities (literature, history, the arts...)</li>
<li>web annotation</li>
<li>digital information filtering and personalization</li>
<li>HCI and building as research</li>
<li>digital preservation (including <a href="http://www.bitcurator.net/bitcurator/">via digital forensics tools</a>)</li>
<li>edition and archive interfaces</li>
<li>scholarly editing and digital edition design</li>
<li>user testing and usability work in the humanities</li>
<li>alternate reality games</li>
<li>James Joyce and <em>Ulysses</em>, Modernist novels, e-lit, comics, videogames, and other weird texts</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Infinite Ulysses</h2>
<p>My research makes the digital humanities more participatory by designing and building for+with the public. With my most recent project, the <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">InfiniteUlysses.com</a> digital edition/social reading platform, I looked to non-academic digital communities including Reddit and StackExchange to address community-authored text and personalization of displayed annotations. Infinite Ulysses invites readers of all backgrounds to come read and discuss James Joyce's challenging novel, supporting annotation (highlight text and add a question/answer, interpretation, definition, translation, etc.) and attempting to personalize what annotations are displayed to each reader's needs and interests.</p>

<h2>Unique digital dissertation</h2>
<p>In Spring 2015, I successfully defended a <a href="http://dr.AmandaVisconti.com">digital humanities dissertation</a> with an innovative form and methodology: design, <a href="https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-dissertation/">code</a>, usertesting, blogging, and an <a href="http://dissertation.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf">analytic whitepaper</a> during the final few weeks before the defense. This dissertation was unique in not employing the usual proto-monograph (written chapters). For more information, check out <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation">my posts from during the dissertation</a> or <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/tag/grad-advice">all posts with advice for digital humanities graduate students</a>. Find the completed dissertation at <a href="dr.AmandaVisconti.com">Dr.AmandaVisconti.com</a>, including the <a href="http://dissertation.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf">whitepaper</a> and the <a href="http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com">InfiniteUlysses.com</a> digital edition/social reading platform I created as the focus of the dissertation. Relatedly, my <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380">master's thesis</a> ran a formal user study of public users encountering scholarly DH interfaces, in order to recommend small design changes that could make such projects serve a wider audience.</p>
